Centralized Radio System About 75 Percent Complete,Unknown,Pen Points,,1934,2,14,1,1,1,1934.02.14.01_PenPoints.jpg,,item,"Centralized Radio System
About 75 Percent Complete

Three National Chains and
Local Station to Furnish 
Programs All Day

Almost 75 percent of the work 
has been completed on the radio
installation project at present,
with RCA engineers hoping that
individual reception will be avail-
able sometime early in March.

The piping conduits and drilling
necessary to reach each cell has all
been completed, while the Control
Units and wiring are also ready
for immediate use. More than 104,-
000 feet of armored cable has been 
used in the gigantic program and
130,000 feet of wire will be drawn
through the conduits before the 
system is completed.

This project is an outgrowth of
the development of radio itself, but
it was only within the last two 
months that the program began to 
formulate concretely. 

The general system of installa-
tion, better known as the Four 
Channel Centralized Radio System,
specifies four ""racks,"" each weigh-
ing almost 600 pounds, with 800
control boxes running from the 
four main channels. Provision has
been made for 1200 outlets direct
to each cell from these control box-
es. 

Three nationwide broadcasting 
systems, and one prominent local
station, will furnish radio programs
every hour of the day. 

Through this method of central-
ized receiving, the best available 
programs at present, can be re-
ceived by each individual at the 
absolute minimum of effort. The
station selection remains entirely
at the choice of the receiver. A
simple regulation of the cell con-
trol boxes will change the program 
immediately to any one of the four
different broadcasting organiza-
tions. 

The cell control boxes will con-
tain nothing more than an ordin-
ary panel with a switch and four
""knots."" Each of the latter will 
be designated to represent one of
the broadcasting systems, and a 
movement of the switch to another 
""knot will immediately change 
the program being received.

Two of the control boxes will 
be installed in each cell. Each set 
of ear-phones will be equipped with
ten feet of wire to permit a great
deal of freedom in movement.
These control boxes lead directly
into the outlet boxes on the out-
side of the cells. The latter, in
turn, go directly to the central re-
ceiving apparatus. 

The ""racks,"" which are being 
installed on the 7th Gallery, are
equally simple when it comes to 
operation. The station reception 
is brought about much in the same
manner as in an ordinary radio
set tuning.

By sealing the dial, no more reg-
ulation is necessary until the send-
ing station ceases to broadcast. At
that time an automatic switch shuts 
off the mechanism. No regulation 
whatsoever, is necessary once our
local receptors pick up the stations
for each of the four channels. 

The expense of radio reception 
is reduced to its absolute minimum 
according to engineers of the RCA 
Company. Outside of the initial 
expenditure, very little cost is nec-
essary to keep the extensive appar-
atus in working order. 

Instead of keeping an individual
receiving set in repair and purchas-
ing tubes and other incidentals, all 
this is done away with in the Cen-
tralized Receiving System. Both
the control boxes and the cell out-
lets contain nothing but simple 
standard parts, with necessary re-
pairs being insignificant in com-
parison to the up-keep of a single
set. Not only is the outlay and re-
pair costs virtually eliminated af-
ter the initial expenditure has been
made, but electrical disturbances 
are also tremendously reduced. The
volume control is likewise automat-
ic, insuring a constant tone regard-
less of outside interference and 
weather conditions. Cross talk, al-
so common in individual reception,
is another ""bugaboo"" that has been 
done away with.

The entire cost of the installa-
tion work will be taken care of by
the Prisoner's Welfare Fund, and
in this manner every member of 
the institution will have access to 
the daily radio programs."

RCA Engineers Hail System
as Best in the Penal
Institutions

According to L. P. Clark and 
Company, local agents for the RCA, 
the Centralized Radio System
which is now being installed in this
institution is the largest to be
found in any penal institution in
the United States.

The Centralized System is used
in such places as the Governor 
Clinton Hotel, Philadelphia Sav-
ings Fund Society Building, Jeffer-
son Medical College and numerous
other places, but the only manner
in which these commercial jobs dif-
fer from the local installation is a
trifling increase in power, and the 
substitution of amplifiers for head-
sets.

All of the equipment is approved
by the RCA and is complete in it-
self. The Antenna System is the
only one to be approved by the
U. S. Government at present for
ships and sea and at naval bases. 

The use of steel ""racks"" permits 
grounding of the radio chassis to
steel frames and thus eliminating
regeneration between radio chan-
nels and also unnecessary noise in-
terference. They also permit better 
ventilation to the mechanism and
naturally cause less depreciation.

At Ossining, N. Y., where a
similar system is installed, the 
""racks"" are the extent of the 
equipment, with the individual sets
being obtained according to the in-
mate selection. While provisions
are made to take care of as many 
outlets as we have here, the indivi-
dual purchase of sets places the 
price out of the reach of a good 
number of the men."
Vocational Education Taking Place of Shop Worn Theories,C.E. Heddes (Director of Education,Pen Points,,1934,2,14,1,1,,1934.02.14.01_PenPoints.jpg,,item,"Vocational Education Taking 
Place of Shop Worn Theories

In the past, Education was some-
thing that was looked upon as be-
ing compulsory; we had to take it;
it was ""supposed"" to be of some
value to us. Just what value, how-
ever, could not be determined very 
concretely.

Some people were of the opinion
that Education was necessary for
its cultural values. In other words,
we could not hope to be a success 
in life unless certain prescribed 
curriculums were mastered. By
undergoing this ordeal one was 
supposed to magically acquire the
where-with-all by which he could
secure an entrance to the more 
select circles in life. 

Some people took a broader view
of the general condition, and prob-
ably for the want of something 
even more indefinite, said that edu-
cation was vital for its social value/
Just what their concrete beliefs
were, no one knew. The doctrine
was exceedingly elastic—first to 
stretch this way, and then again to
stretch that.

At the same time, those indivi-
duals who prided themselves in
being ""practical,"" took an entire-
ly different view. Said they, ""Ed-
ucation is essential in training the 
man to fit the environment,"" but
in the same breath, used the latter 
term as something all-inclusive.

Regardless of overlapping be-
liefs these groups held, it is suffici-
ent to say that no one ever thought
of tying education to a job in any
manner except in a college where
one was supposed to specialize in 
such pursuits.

A marked change has taken 
place, however, in the past ten
years in the form of the Vocational
Education Movement—or, ""educa-
tion for a job."" In short, we have 
become a Nation going back to
school. Instead of classes being a 
recognition of one's limited educa-
tion, going to school is now the 
complimentary determination of 
one's progressive desire to keep up
to date.

Thus the school in this institution
aims to provide the tools for bet-
ter, pleasanter, and more harmon-
ious living, so that, those who can-
not now read or write their own
letters may be able to do this;
those who are not able to hold pos-
itions in the institution may qual-
ify for employment; and finally
those who have never prepared
themselves to hold a job may make 
that preparation here and be ready
for desirable employment on their 
return to society.

Explained in Full

Detailed explanation given in
order to clarify method of
securing papers

One of the questions that arises 
quite frequently is, ""I wish to 
make application to the State Board
of Pardons for commutation of 
sentence. Where and how do I get 
my papers?"" The following will 
answer this oft repeated query:—

Applications that have never
been before the Board are original
cases. Those that have been pre-
viously considered are rehearing
cases. If the applicant is under
sentence of death, the application
is a capital case.

Send $1.00 to the Secretary,
Board of Pardons, Department of
Justice, Harrisburg, Pa., for forms. 
State whether the application is
original, rehearing, or capital case.
The forms must be prepaid.

Fill these forms out carefully by
typewriter. The original must be 
signed by the applicant and two
witnesses. In rehearing cases, new
and substantial reasons must be
presented on the rehearing forms.
Supplemental sheets may be added.
To each copy of the rehearing form 
must be attached, but not perman-
ently, an exact copy of the original 
applciation on new original forms.

Return the original and eight 
copies to the Secretary. A filing
fee of $10.00 is charged and must 
accompany the application. The 
filing fee is never returned. Checks
or money orders must be made pay-
able to the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania.

Applications filed on or before 
the 10th day of the month will be
considered at the Board's Execu-
tive Session the following month.
If the Board shall then be of the
opinion that the application is not
worthy of hearing, it shall forth-
with refuse the applciation; and if 
it shall determine to grant a hear-
ing in open session, the applicant's 
representative will be notified as
to the time, date and place of such 
hearing. (Example) An application
filed before January 10th, will be 
considered in the February Execu-
tive Session. Hearing if allowed, 
will be in March. Fifteen minutes 
will be allowed to each side for ar-
gument in non-capital cases; thirty 
minutes in capital cases.

Anyone may act as the appli-
cant's representative. Lawyers
must be members of the bar of the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. 
Only lawyers may charge fees and 
the Board reserves the right to in-
quire into the fee paid and if it
deems it excessive to require a re-
duction thereof. Any attorney who
refuses to reduce a fee in accord-
ance with a requirement of the
Board to do so shall thereafter be
ineligible to practice before the 
Board.

If the applicant has been sent-
enced to a county prison or work-
house, a formal application for pa-
role must be made to the trial
court and refused before an appli-
cation will be considered by the 
Board of Pardons. A certified copy
of the court order refusing parole 
must accompany the application.

All material to be filed with the 
application should be sent to the 
Secretary not later than two weeks
after date of filing.

In no case will a petition for re-
hearing be considered until six
months have expired after the re-
fusal of the original application.

No reasons are given for the re-
fusal of an application.

Follow the above instructions 
carefully. The applicant's repre-
sentative will be notified by the 
Secretary if anything else needs be
done."

Parole Laws Given in Detail

Act of Assembly Covering 
Release and Violation set
forth to aid eligible

BOARD OF TRUSTEES' 
WORK ALSO RELATED

The dictionary defines the word 
parole thus: ""In penology, the re-
lease of a prisoner under promise 
not to violate the law; to release a 
prisoner on this word of honor to
observe certain conditions.""

The Act of Assembly, aproved 
the 10th day of May, A.D., 1909, in-
augurated the present system of 
release by Parole, as well as the 
penalty for violating parole. This
Act set up the minimum and max-
imum sentences, and the eligi-
bility of prisoners for release on
parole at the expiration of their
minimum sentence, subject to con-
ditions as laid down by law. Sub-
sequent Acts of Assembly have 
made it mandatory that a prisoner 
sentenced to a state penitentiary 
must have a minimum and a max-
imum sentence, and the minimum
setence shall not exceed one-half 
of the maximum sentence.

Parole, as it affects an inmate of
the Eastern State Penitentiary, 
can be divided into two distinct 
classifications: 
(A) Preliminary steps and procedure to-
ward obtaining a parole.
(B) Requirements and operation of the
Parole Laws as they affect a parole
prisoner.

Let us follow these two classifi-
cations closely, as it will solve many
of the perplexing questions con-
fronting every inmate as the time
draws near for his opportunity to 
make application for release on 
parole.

""A""—The Acts of Assembly set up
the procedure that shall be followed
in considering the applications. They
vest in the Board of Trustees of the 
State Penitentiaries the power and the 
duty of considering every inmate for
parole within a period of three months
prior to the expiration of his minimum
sentence, and making a recommendation
to the Governor as to whether such
convict shall be released on parole.

This recommendation must first be
sent to the Board of Pardons for ap-
proval. When, and if, the Board of 
Pardons approve the recommendation
of the Board of Trustees, then the 
Board of Pardons presents the recom-
mendation for release on parole to the
Governor. The Board of Pardons must
approve all recommendations for re-
lease on parole, or reparole, which
might be made by the Board of Trust-
ees of the Eastern State Penitentiary,
before they are presented to the Gover-
nor for his official action.

The Board of Pardons, by virtue of 
the fact that they must approve all 
recommendations for release on parole
to the Governor, have set up certain
requirements which they feel essential,
and in the absence of which they refuse 
to present the recommendation. These
requirements can be listed as follows:

1. An inmate must have a suitable, law-
abiding sponsor.
2. He must have a job or a good home to 
go to.
3. Lacking the job or home, he must have 
sufficient funds to enable him to be 
self-supporting for a reasonable length
of time in which to procure work for
himself. (Amount fixed by the Pardon
Board at approximately $150.00)
4. If the inmate is to be turned over to
other jurisdiction on detainer or other-
wise, and if he is to be deported.

The above requirements are set by 
the Board of Pardons, and not by the 
Board of Trustees. The requirements
of the Board of Trustees are set by 
law, but the Board of Pardons can insist 
on any requirement they see fit for 
what they think is the best interest of 
everyone concerned. It would be a 
waste of time for the Board of Trust-
ees of this institution to forward any
recommendation to the Bard of Par-
dons for approval, if there were not 
attached to the recommendation proof
of the fact that the requirements of 
the Board of Pardons had been met as
regards sponsor, work, home, etc. There
fore, no recommendation is forwarded
without the conditions of the Pardon
Board having first been met by the in-
mate eligible for parole. 

How can you fulfill the above condi-
tions? That is where the function of 
the Parole Department of the Eastern
State Penitentiary operates.

Approximately three months prior to
the expiration of an inmate's minimum
setnence he is given an Application for
Parole. On this applciation there is a 
space provided for the names and ad-
dresses of any persons who the inmate
feels might act as sponsor and/or em-
ployer for him if released on parole.
The Parole Department writes to the 
people mentioned asking them to act
in the capacity of sponsor or employer,
or both. The inmate should also write
to anyone he knows who he thinks will
assist him in this critical period.

The more people who are contacted 
in this manner the more opportunities 
are liable to be unearthed for sponsors
and possible offers of employment. Give
the Parole Officer the names of all pos-
sible friends or relatives, with their ad-
dresses, so he can write them all in 
your interest.

When any replies are received they 
are turned over to the Field Agents of 
the Department of Justice, who work
under the Board of Pardons. These
Field Agents investigate the offers made
in the letters, making a report of their
investigation, this report being for the
Board of Pardons. If the report is re-
turned satisfactory, and the Board of 
Trustees have approved the parole of 
any inmate subject to such satisfactory
report being received, then the recom-
mendation of the Board of Trusteres is 
forwarded to the Board of Pardons for 
approval. 

Of course, it is within the power of 
the Board of Trustees to refuse to rec-
commend any inmate for parole. Some
of the reasons that a parole might be
refused by the Board of Trustees are:

1. Bad institutional record, as regards con-
duct or work, or both.
2. Lengthy criminal record.
3. Antagonistic attitude, and lack of co-
operation with those you came in contact
with, as displayed during confinement.

After the recommendation of the 
Board of Trustees is forwarded to the
Board of Pardons it takes a little time
for the recommendation to come up for
consideration by that Board, and then
procuring the signed approval of the
Governor, sometimes taking as long as 
two or three weeks. For this reason it
is best to get after your prospective
sponsors and employers at least two or
three months prior to your eligible re-
lease date, so that the approved investi-
gation report and the recommendations
of the Board of Trustees can be in the 
hands of the Board of Pardons in suffi-
cient time to eliminate the possibility 
of any delay in your release.

Bear in mind at all times that the 
officials of this instittuion, and the of-
ficers in the Parole Department, are
interested in seeing that you are re-
leased when you are eligible for release,
and are ready to assit in any way pos-
sible. Naturally they cannot do the im-
possible, you must co-operate. Feel
free to ask them for any assistance, at
any time, in your problems.

""B""—Let us assume that your rec-
ommendation for parole has been ap-
proved by the Board of Pardons and
the Governor. You are now ready for 
discharge on parole. By an Act of 
Assembly, approved the 1st day of 
May, 1929, the State Board of Pardons, 
assumes supervision of all men released
on parole from the Eastern and Western 
State Penitentiaries, and the Pennsyl-
vania Industrial School at Huntingdon.
So you come directly under the super-
vision of the Board of Pardons the 
moment you are released. The officials
of this institution ahve no further jur-
isdiction over you, unless you violate 
your parole and the Supervisor of Pa-
roles, by authority of the Board of 
Pardons, orders your return to the 
penitentiary. In that event we again
assume jurisdiction over you.

The plan as established by the State 
Board of Pardons for supervision of 
the men on parole is briefly outlined as
follows: 

When released from the penitentiary
you are given a copy of the rules and
regulations to be observed while on pa-
role. You should read these over and
make every effort to co-operate in ob-
serving them. You are advised to re-
port to a specific Field Agent who has
supervision of all paroled prisoners in
the locality where you plan to reside. 
This Field Agent will visit you at least 
once a month. He is your friend, and
his purpose is to counsel, advise and
assist you, whenever and wherever pos-
sible, in your efforts to regain your 
normal place in society again. These
Field Agents are responsible to the 
Supervisor of Paroles, who in turn is 
responsible to the Board of Pardons.

You are advised that violations of 
the rules and regulations will subject
you to return to the penitentiary. By pro-
visions of the Act of Assembly of May
10, 1909, if you are convicted of a crime 
while on parole it is mandatory that 
you return to serve the full maximum 
sentence as originally imposed, without
any credit for the time you were out.
So don't commit a crime on parole and
then when you get back to the institu-
tion expect the officials to find some
loop-hole through which they can re-
parole you. Their hands are tied by
law.

Infractions of the fules and regula-
tions, such as failure to report, chang-
ing addresses without permission, being 
drunk and disorderly in conduct, etc., 
when they cause your return, permit
your being reparoled, but not until such 
time as approved by the Supervisor of
Paroles, and the Board of Pardons.

You will note the important 
points:

1. Attend to the matter of sponsorship and
employment promptly and insufficient
time so there will be no delay in your
release at the proper time.
2. Your supervision while on parole is not 
by the officials of the penitentiary
3. A violation of parole by conviction for
another crime while on parole prhibits
consideration for reparole."

Ample opportunity is given to
all inmates to attend religious ser-
vices of the Protestant, the Cath-
olic and the Jewish Groups. There
is an emphasis placed upon the val-
ue of public worship, conformity 
to the principles of the religious
preferences cited at the time of 
the individual's admission to the
prison, and the study of the Word
of God under capable teaching.
The larger influences of religion
within this prison is unquestion-
ably the personal application of
its principles to the domestic and 
case problems of the inmate pop-
ulation. The loss of liberty provokes
the tremendous urge to regain that 
liberty. There are comforts and 
reconciliations in the message of 
all religions. There is value in the 
worship of the public assembly.
There is, however, no substitute for
the lifting power of personal coun-
sel which interprets the shattered 
hopes of a segregated group and
restores the individuals of such
group to the prospect of new starts
in life for themselves and the re-
newed confidence of their neigh-
bors. We subscribe to the liberal
personal contact of selected clergy-
men in the creation of new hopes
where despair may prevail.

To take things as they be—
That's my philosophy.
No use to holler, mope, or cuss—
If they was changed they might be wuss.

If rain is pouring down,
An lightnin's buzzin round
I ain't a-fearin' we'll be hit,
But grin that I ain't out in it.

If I get deep in debt,
It hasn't happened yet—
And owed a man two dollars, Gee:
Why, I'd be glad it wasn't three.

If some one come along, 
And tried to do me wrong,
Why I should sort of take a whim
To thank the Lord I wasn't him.

The Sky Devil's Code,Unknown,Pen Points,,1934,2,14,1,1,,1934.02.14.02_PenPoints.jpg,,item,"The Sky Devil's Code

THE SECOND DAY he joined the 
Twelfth Bristol Fighter Squad-
ron, Tim Barbour got his repu-
tation, and it was an evil one. So
was his nickname—the natural af-
termath of his reputation. Even 
the grease-balls took it upon them-
selves to be uppity with him. Ev-
erybody in the Twelfth called him 
""Chicken-Heart.""

When a man is called Chicken-
Heart, it can mean but one thing
—that he is a coward. And that
indeed was the Twelfth's opinion
of Barbour. They called him
Chicken-Heart to his face—and he
swallowed it and made no protest.

Wing companies excuse a great
deal in a man. He may be a boast-
er, a drunkard, a fool, wastrel; but
if he can fight, all these faults are
too easily forgiven and forgotten.
Not so with the cardinal sin of 
cowardice. That is the one fault 
which flyers—men who daily, hour-
ly, risk life and limb in the clouds
—will not abide.

Barbour learned, to his misery,
that the reputation of being a cow-
ard was all too easily gained and 
almost impossible to erase. He 
gained it one night in the local
estaminet where members of the
Twelfth were wont to foregather of
an evening to swap songs. Here
stories of the day's exploits were 
recounted, and the men limbered
up their fight-jaded sense with
white and red Frog lubricant.

Barbour had just come up from
Issoudon with a load of green
wingmen in the replacements. He
was tipping a glass to his lips when
someone jostled his elbow. The
glass flew from his fingers, its con-
tents be-spattering the face, collar
and tunic of one Mike McGovern,
a half-wing and observer. Now
Mike was Irish and Tim Barbour
was red-haired, lithe and rangy.
The members of the Twelfth looked
forward with eager interest to a 
good scrap. They knew Mike. He
loved nothing better than an even-
ing's stand-up-and-knock-down-
brawl. They expected Barbour's 
red hair was an indication of fistic
propensities. But in that they were 
woefully disappointed. No sooner
had Mike arisen, with the wild bel-
lowings of a maddened bull, than
Tim Barbour also rose to his feet
—white, trembling, unnerved.

No one spoke at sight of the agi-
tated young man. In fact many 
of the Twelfth's wingmen looked
away as would men whose stom-
achs proved too squeamish. They
couldn't bear to see a two-fisted
kid backing down. And that is
just what he did. Tim Barbour
backed down. He listened, with a
nervous, deprecating grin, to Mike's
abusive flow of language. Mike
called him everything from a skunk
to things unprintable. He took it
with a strained smile, his hands
gripping the edge of the table so
tightly that the knuckles showed a
line of white. His face wore a
tight unhappy look. That look—
members of the Twelfth interpret-
ed as meaning only one thing—
Tim Barbour was afraid.

""I'm—I'm very sorry,"" he said
in a low, hesitant voice when Mike
paused to take a breath. ""It won't
-er-happen again, I assure you.
Please forget it.""

""Shore, an' why should Oi for-
get, yuh lanky bean-pole?"" roared
the obstreperous Mike. ""Why, yuh
look so damn scairt, Oi wonder can
yuh raise yore fists to fight, by
golly.""

""Please,"" muttered Barbour.
""I apologized. That ought to be
enough. I don't care to fight.""

""Don't care,"" bellowed Mike,
unabashed, ""it's afraid yuh are, 
that's what it is. Why for two 
cents—"" He broke off in complete 
disgust. ""What's the use? You're 
yellow.""

Not even at that insulting re-
mark did Barbour take offense. He
grinned a sickly grin, then sub-
sided into his seat, face flaming
with embarrassment. Mike McGov-
ern turned away. And so did every
other member of the Twelfth. In
five minutes Tim Barbour found
he was sitting alone at his table.
In ten minutes he was in sole pos-
session of the entire corner. The
next morning his reputation was
consolidated. He was ""Chicken-
Heart"" Barbour to everybody.

He was an outcast—branded a coward.

* * * 

So passed a month. 
Barbour still hung on. It was
thought that he would seek to
be transferred where at least his
reputation was unkown, but he 
made no such move. The night of
June 18th, he was sitting in his
tiny room. From the estaminet 
came strains of happy music—
piano and voice. Suddenly, like a
bolt out of the dark sky overhead,
came a series of bombs. One struck
the landing field, plowing up the 
turf. Another missed the Admin-
istration building by a couple of 
yards. The third bit the estaminet.
Out of the chaos and the thunder, 
out of the screams of the wounded
and dying, came a steady voiced
summons.

""A Boche bombing party. To 
the air, men. Toddle out the 
crates."" The Twelfth never knew
that the voice so bold, so steady,
so challenging was that of Chicken-
Heart Barbour. In ten minutes
three planes had been rolled out
of the hangars. Their motors were
kicked over and they tore cross-
wind down the field, zooming for 
the stars. In one of the three
planes, Mike McGovern was busy
buckling himself into the observer's
seat. In the rush and hurry of the
take-off, he had not seen his part-
ner. He thumped the camel back
that separated pilot and observer
and the pilot turned about. Both 
men looked surprised, but Mike's
face also registered disgust. The
pilot was Chicken-Heart Barbour.
""I would draw the lemon,"" growled
Mike.

Anti-aircraft batteries were
shooting for all they were worth.
Three streaks of brilliant white 
light speared the heavens, marking 
the positions of the Fokker D7s.
Before the first of the three Bris-
tols got her proper fighting alti-
tude, two of the Fokkers swooped
down upon her and blasted her out
of the sky. It looked like a rout.
Mike swore under his breath, gave
his Vickers a warming burst. He
shouted as he recognized one of 
the Boche planes as that of von
Stollen, the famed German ace.
But he was busy the next second
keeping another of the Fokkers off
his tail. Out of the corner of his 
eye, he saw von Stollen rush at the 
Bristol. He groaned, but Barbour 
instantly shot the ship into a zoom. 
Up and down across and back, the
planes wheeled, looped, zoomed,
dived. The Germans were fast
getting the upper hand.

Barbour was flying like a gen-
ius or a maniac; it was hard to tell
which. Like a comet, the German
ace ripped across the Bristol's path 
and fired a blazing stream into her 
nose. Mike himself was shooting
wildly. He yelled lustily as one of
the Fokkers tumbled earthward, a
pillar of descending flame. Pour-
ing full gun to the roaring Rolls
motor, Barbour tore at von Stollen.
But suddenly the German ace's 
Spandau stream stopped. Just as
suddenly a searchlight caught the 
Fokker and Barbour and Mike saw
von Stollen's hands—both of them
—raised above his head.

It was a moment for a perfect
burst from Barbour's guns, but he
did not fire. Those raised hands
of the Boche reitmeister meant one
thing: his gun had jammed. One
blast and the German ace would be 
no more. But Barbour, instead of 
firing, threw the Bristol around in
a steep bank, saw that the other 
Bristol was more than holding its
own against the second Fokker.
Then he saw flickering tongues of
orange and green flame spurt from
von Stollen's Spandrau. The gun
was working again. The German 
waved a hand, and Barbour also
waved. Grinning Mike McGovern
waved back also.

And then the fierce battle was re-
sumed in earnest. Roaring Vickers
were matched against spattering 
Spandau; Yankee grit against Ger-
man nerve. Fire and flame against
flame and fire. Bullets crackled
against bullets, mile high in the
sky. Molten steel hit at Barbour's 
gun hand. But before the hand
was disabled he launched a scald-
ing stream of tracers into the Fok-
ker's belly. Blood poured from his
hand, but he paid no attention.
One of his bullets had hit the mark.
Von Stollen's Fokker exploded in
mid-air, lighting up the sky. Cov-
ered with blood and smeared with
grit and oil, Barbour clambered
from the cock-pit. Mike McGovern
threw an arm around him.

""Brother,"" said Mike, ""kick me.
Kick me damned hard. Oi've been
a fool, calling yuh Chicken-Heart.
'Tis 'Great-Heart' yuh should be
named. As soon as Oi seen yuh give 
that Jerry ace a chancet when his
gun jammed, Oi knew yuh was no
coward. It took nerve to let him
get an even chancet against yuh.
There ain't anuther pilot in the 
company would'a done it.""

Mike's voice dropped. ""But, son,
why didn't yuh put up your fists
to me that first night? Hell, I bet
yuh could lick me.""

Barbour grinned happily. ""Lick
you? Sure, with one hand behind
my back. Listen, I didn't feel
called upon to explain before, but 
now I will. Years ago, I took an 
oath never to fight. Sounds funny,
huh? Well, here's why.

""I got red hair and a terrible 
temper. Once I nearly killed a
guy in a fight. You see, I just for-
get everything, my mind goes
blank. I'm—I'm like crazy. So I 
made myself promise never again
to fight. It's the only way. It's
the code I wrote for myself.""

""Yeah,"" echoed Mike, slapping
Barbour on the shoulder. ""Call it
the sky-devil's code.""

The Question Box,Unknown,Pen Points,,1934,2,14,1,1,,1934.02.14.04_PenPoints.jpg,,item,"The Question Box

1. Question:—If granted com-
mutation of sentence by the State
Board of Pardons at the February
meeting, how soon thereafter will
I be released?

Answer:—First it is neces-
sary that the official papers,
signed by the Governor cer-
tifying to the commutation
of your sentence, be received
at this Institution. After re-
ceipt of the official papers,
you are given a hearing be-
fore the institution Parole
Board, and generally recom-
mended for parole. This rec-
ommendation for parole must
then be forwarded to the 
State Board of Pardons at
its next meeting. The Board
of Pardons then considers
the recommendation for
your parole and if approved,
the papers are forwarded to
the Governor for his signa-
ture. After which they are 
sent to the Institution. Up-
on receipt of the Parole pa-
pers, you are then released.
It generally takes from 4 to 
6 weeks from the date of the
granting of commutation.

* * * *

2. Question:—If I am granted 
commutation of sentence by the
State Board of Pardons, do the pa-
role regulations govern me in the
same manner as an inmate released
on parole at the expiration of his
minimum sentence?

Answer:—Yes. Commutat-
tion of sentence by the State
Board of Pardons is reduc-
ing the time of your mini-
mum sentence to expire on a
date fixed by the Pardon 
Board. Your parole is then
secured in the same manner
as if your minimum sentence 
had expired, and you are
subjected to all the rules and
regulations of the State Pa-
role Board in the same man-
ner as an inmate released at 
the expiration of his sent-
ence. For example, if you
were serving a 10 to 20 year
sentence and made applica-
tion to the State Board of 
Pardons after having served
4 years and were successful
in receiving favorable action
by the Board of Pardons, 
your sentence would then 
read from 4 to 20 years and
would be subject to the pa-
role regulations for a period 
of 16 years.

* * * *

3. Question:—If I desire infor-
mation on questions not clear in 
my mind about my sentence, par-
don, or parole matters, how could
I secure this information?

Answers—At 2:30 P.M. each
Wednesday, interviews are 
held by the Institution and
State Parole Officers who at
this time will attempt to an-
swer any questions that are
placed before them. These in-
terviews are held in the De-
puty's Office or any other of-
fice nearby.

* * * *

4. Question:—When making ap-
plication to the State Pardon 
Board, is it necessary to employ
an Attorney?

Answer:—No. The Officials
of the INstitution are very glad
to give assistance in this mat-
ter. Consult your Chaplain
who will advise you how to
have your papers made out
without the employment of an 
Attorney."

In this class there is exhaustive
study made, with the Bible as the

order that they might have a bibli-

many of the men are unquestion-

Education has no beginning and
no end. Children begin to read be-
fore they begin to talk. Aged men
and women continue to learn until
the time of physical dissolution.
The world is a school, humanity is
a succession of classes at study.
Every crisis, every moral test, ev-
ery demand for judgment, is an
examination. In the end, the great-
est degree of all is in the thought
that one may face the hereafter 
without fear.

Colleges have no magic. They
cannot transmute base metal into
gold. They organize and coordin-
ate the world's offerings in learn-
ing and in wisdom. Those offerings
are everywhere. To the man or
woman unable to go to college, they
are yet at hand and available. Read
—Read good books!

All the thoughts of the ancient 
philosophers are set down in print
for all generations. Aristotle, Plato
and the rest are gone, yet they re-
main forever. The great struggles
of humanity to rise; the uncon-
querable determination of the race
to achieve freedom and happiness;
these are on the records. Readers 
of books can live again the emo-
tions that have swayed people and
determined the boundaries of na-
tions. The high thoguhts of Emer-
son and the gentle humor of Dr. 
Holmes, these remain with us—
friendly companions that will come
at a gesture. The singing narra-
tives of Homer go singing through 
the ages.

Read—there is no book which
youths will read in preparation for
the mid-year of final examinations,
which those who are not in institu-
tions of learning may not have for 
themselves. There is no wealth of
learning which one may not ap-
proach through the printed page.

We hear praise for the man who
does things. Achievement, consum-
mation of purpose, these are entitled
to the admiration they receive. Yet
there never has been any deed done
in this mortal world which did not
have its preceding thought; and
the printed word is the vehicle for
most of the world's thought.

Through many centuries fine-
minded men have been striving to
advance human understanding and
wisdom. All that they have done
through the centuries is at your 
door.
