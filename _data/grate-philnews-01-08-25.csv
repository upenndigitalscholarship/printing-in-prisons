Card for July 4

Holiday Program

HAM vs. “THE WONDER”

Six bouts and at least three novelty
sketches have been arranged for the an-
nual Fourth of July boxing program at
the House. While not wishing to detract
from the two previous cards, the holi-
day bill should be far the most interest
ing yet presented.

Not only will there be plenty of com-
edy, but a top notch fight program and
possibly one or two celebrities to help
out at the ringside.

The long awaited bout between Bugs
Golden and Godfrey, and a return go be-
tween Frankie Mayo and Slug Aggie are
the double wind-up features on the all
star card.

Bugs has fought the best in the land
in outside rings and toured with the one
and only Jack Dempsey for a spell.
Although he stopped fighting a little
over a year ago and is rapidly topping
the 200-mark, Bugs still has plenty of
his old time skill.

Godfrey is up around the 195-mark
and is purely a local boy. He is one of
the best fighters ever to be seen in the
House and has won every one of his
fights with the exception of one with
George Kuchini in his second start.

""I’m in to fight—give and take any-
thing—It all depends on the other fel-
low,’’ said Golden up in the Chapel
recently, while Godfrey vows he will
‘‘give him all he wants and take a
little in return too.’’ What a battle this
promises to be!

Of the Frankie Mayo-Slug Aggie tiff,
little need be said. This duo captured
first prize in the opening show with three
blistering rounds that had the crowd in
an uproar from the outset. Aggie put
a big dent in Mayo’s outside reputation,
but the swarthy hued serapper is bent
on turning the tables.

The supporting card has several bouts
which might upset the dope and, walk
away with some of the choice prizes.
Joe Sharkey, making his first start in
here will take on Dick Pike. Dutch Mor-
gan was all set to try for his third
straight knockout against Pike, but was
forced to withdraw when he sprained an
ankle playing basketball. Pike showed
promise in his tussle with Morgan and
will probably give Sharkey a severe test.

The gum-chewing Rebel Hogan, who
caught the crowd’s faney with a clever
two-fisted attack against Phil Cavan,
takes on the veteran K.O. Pat. The lat-
ter is a veteran of many ring battles,
but has been inactive for several years.
Don’t be at all surprised if this one
finishes near the top in the awards.

Suitease Yorkie makes his first start
of the year against Young Harry, who
is out to repeat the K.O. win he tabbed
in his first start against Pat York in
the opening card. The ever laughing
Yorkie has a score of local fights under
his belt and can handle himself with
the best of them. Another interesting
bout, to say the least! In the third bout
Jim Brooks makes his first start against
the veteran Yam Flowers, who dropped
his first bout to Bobby Scotten.

But the prize bout of them all comes
just before the double wind-up, when
the incomparable Ham stacks up against
the ‘‘Unknown Wonder’’. The pride of
the Armour Belt had all kinds of trouble
securing an opponent, but ‘‘Unknown’’
was finally coaxed into the match. What
a slugger this boy Ham is! What foot-
work! It’s collossal! Little Jimmy will)
probably stake his reputation as a ref-
eree in this tussle, the others will be
handled by outside men."

Both places going over the 100
mark constantly despite
other attractions

School attendance at Philadelphia is
picking up again. There were 105 men
in school last Wednesday.

Phil Cain, teacher at Philadelphia, is
recovering from his fourth operation and
visited the school the other day in a
wheel chair, Says he just can’ stay
away. Phil has complete use of his arm
and hand now and we will be glad to
see him back at his desk again.

Just wait until you see the Landscap-
ing job the students and faculty are
doing around the school building at
Graterford. We'll neutralize the unsight-
liness of those ugly coal piles yet.

Can you imagine it? Over 100 men in
eyening school at Graterford last Wed-
nesday night (102 to be exact). And
they told us no one would come to night
school these nice summer evenings with
baseball and movies to pull them away.

Four hundred baby chicks in the
Brooder House; fifteen flourishing vege-
table garden plots and several Landscape
gardening projects! How’s that for a
going program of projects in Agricul-
tural Education at Graterford?

Thirty-five students in the afternoon
classes at Philadelphia. Thirty-five men
giving up part of yard-out to go to
school. Well, we will admit we hardly
expected it but it sure is gratifying to
know that our service is appreciated to
that extent.

Two more office clerks placed from
school students this month. Little by lit-

GAMES
Won 21 — Lost 6

All good things must come to an end!
Yes, even the winning streak of the
House volleyball team. The locals came
within a hair of defending its streak
successfully and also creating one of the
biggest upsets in Philadelphia volley-
ball circles before losing, however.

A determined rally in the last three
games finally gave the North Branch
Y.M.C.A. a 3-2 victory over the Light
and Dark Blue team.

The visitors: have the reputation of
being the perennial champions of Phila-
delphia and in last winter’s National
Championship play at the University of
Tennessee, finished runner-up to Chica-
go and Houston, Texas. Several years
ago, and with practically the same team,
the ""Y"" sextette won the National
Championship.

After a shaky start in which the House
gave the visitors more points on faults
than on actual errors, the locals pulled
themselves together and lifted the first
game out of the fire, 15-11. What a
surprise that was!

In that tilt the Dark and Light Blue
team did not ‘‘rotate’’ as is customary
in outside play, but the boys played the
visitors at their own game in the second
engagement and again won out, dupli-
cating the count of the opener.

The work of Big Slim, out of ecompe-
tition in the two previous matches on
account of lumbago, was a revelation.
Slim made almost impossible shots and
made the ‘‘Y’’ players look foolish on
several occasions

The House team appeared to be head-
ing for victory in straight games when
it got away to an early lead in the third,
and what would have been the deciding
match. Needing only two points for
victory, two misplays in the back court
jand nice shots by Schuck and Wurz-
boch for the ""Y"", enabled North
Branch to eke out a 15-13 triumph.

Winters, Babs, Stucky, Engle and
Buddy saw action in place of the regu-
lars in this and the fourth game, and
after dropping the 15-13 setto, folded
up in the fourth and were outclassed,
15-2.

The regulars swung back into action
in the fifth and all important game, but
could not halt the relentless attack of 
the visitors. With the final outcome in 
the balance, North Branch romped to a
15-4 triumph.

Chi Slim, Big Slim, Engle, Irish,
Blackie and Gyp made up the starting
lineup for the House, while Scheam,
Spealler, Tidbolt, Hall, Wurzboch and
Schuck represented North Branch. Orn-
jer, Bodie, Strobel and Satinsky also saw
action for the victors.

Mr. Idell, known throughout the coun-
try as the ‘‘Father of Volleyball"",
refereed the tilt."

Farm nine chases Simmons
Powhida to gain a 10- 8
victory

Showins absolutely no regard tor the
highly vaunted Penn Athletic Club nine,
composed of some of the best collegiate
athletes turned out in the East, the All-
Star nine at the Farm clustered six runs
in the seventh inning to turn back ie
Thomas’ club, 10-8.

Trailing 7-4 in the lucky seventh,
Whitey ’s single chased Ray home and
F. Rip’s double tabbed Meehan and H.
Whitey with the tying runs. Coach
Buck’s club took the lead a moment
later when Johnny Reds laced out a two
bagger that sent F. Rip scampering to
the plate, “and before the inning was
over, Lefty's beautiful bunt allowed
Kelly and John Reds to sneak home
with the ninth and tenth runs.

Simmons was on the hill when the
All-Stars started golfing the apple and
Johnny Powhida, former University of
Pennsylvania great, went in to squelch
the uprising.. After four of his pitches
were sent back to him faster than he
threw them plateward, Carson Thompson
ascended the knoll.

Thompson, former Temple University
star, just recently garnered his 29th
consecutive victory while hurling for
Stonehurst A.A. and showed plenty in
the eighth, but it was too late to mean
anything.

The first six men on the All-Star team
accounted for all of the Stars? bingles,
Meehan and J. Reds leading with three,
H. Whitey, F. Rip and Lefty each get-
ting two, and Kelly one. F, Rip, Kelly,
Lefty and J. Reds had two baggers and
the latter also had a triple.

Rolfe ‘‘Swede’’ Carlsten, who led the
Intercollegiate League batters and earned
a tryout in the International League
after graduating from Penn, led Penn
A.C. with a long home run and a triple.
Walt Hddowes took what was left of the
batting laurels with a double and two
singles.

Kelly played a beautiful game at
short for the Stars, handling nine chane-
es without a boot, while Jimmy Dough-
erty did the best work afield for Penn
A.C. with five chances. Berry and Ray
handled the pitching assignment for the
victors, and although touched for thirteen
bingles, kept them well scattered.

It was only the third defeat for Penn
A.C. and the first reverse since playing
semi-professional ball. Temple University
with Hddie Cramer, the star southpaw
who is now with the Washington Sena-
tors hurling both games, administered
both previous defeats. In addition to
turning back Pennsylvania and other
leading colleges in these parts, the elub-
men have been sweeping through the
best sandlot teams around these parts.

Farm nine will attempt to start
new streak against
Reading club

The powerful Ajax A.C. of Reading,
Pa, will be the opposition for the All-
Star nine and wind up a full day of
athletics at the Farm on the Fourth of
July. The ball game will be played in
the afternoon and a large crowd of spec-
tators is expected for the fuss.

The Farm tossers have been going at
a merry clip this season and have built
up a mice record. They have captured
eight of the ten games played to date,
excluding the game with the Olney Aces
Saturday.

Coach Buck’s nine started off with
four straight wins, defeating Skippack,
2-1, 45th Ward, 9-4, Roxborough, 17-9,
and the Parkway Baking Company, 23-6.
Quakertown broke the slate with a 5-4
triumph in a listless game, but the All- —
Stars got started on another streak with-
out wasting any time.

Hampden, the same team yen de-
feated Quakertown 12-4, suffered a 21-6
shellacking, the Moree lost 9-8, Penn
A.C. bowed, 10-8, and the Rangers lost
a 2-1 squeeze. Kennett Square had the
honor of being the second team to de-
feat the locals, turning in an 8-6 card.

The Ajax club will lineup with Clay,
Burns and Remley in the outfield and
Rohrback and Mancuso forming the bat-
tery. The infield, starting at first and
swinging around the diamond, will be
made up of Brown, Painter, Beard and
Knowleski. Ertel, Klingaman, Walters,
Huzzard, Strunk and Herman are the
spares who will probably see action be-
for the game is over."

Religion and the Inmate,Unknown,Grate-Phil News,,1934,7,3,1,5,2,1999.011.038GratePhilNewsVerso.jpg,,item,"Religion and the Inmate

Figures tell us that about 25% of the
religious services regularly. That figure
may be a little high for the Hastern
State Penitentiary, but whether 25% is
the correct figure for this or any other
institution is not the point under dis-
cussion. We know that\ the vast majority
of the inmates of our institutions: do not
attend religious services.

A very insignificant: few of our in-
mates deny that they have any 
convictions. Most of them admit belong-
ing to some denomination. Since they
belong to some Church, it would be the
logical thing for them to attend services
held by their Church behind the walls.

The popular excuses in jail for the
man not attending his denominational
service are, that he never attended when
he was free, so why attend now; and
secondly, that only the hypocrite attends
religious services while under confine-
ment. These excuses, if they may be
called such, are the standard ones and
the man who would be a real convict
tries to live down to these standards.
The carelessness for religious service,
the indifference toward the practice of
his religious tenents that marked the
free man, are still dominant in the man
incarcerated, which would tend to show
a lack of moral reform. Had he been
strict in his attendance at Church, had
he observed carefully the spirit and let-
ter of the dogmas of his faith, he would
never have fallen into crime. Religion
precludes crime.

The attendance at Church Services is
a publie attestation that the one pres-
ent believes in God and has presented
himself at the service to join his prayer
with that of his brother. By his very
presence at Church he tells the world
that he acknowledges that he believes
in God and his Creator, his Redeemer
and his Judge.

The man in jail has lost one of the
dearest possessions that he has ... his
liberty. He therefore needs something—
he wants something. It has been his sad
experience that the moment his troubles
overtook him, his so-called friends fled
him like rats from a sinking ship. Hyen
his relatives turned away from him be-
cause he brought the family name into
disrepute.

The agencies of Justice perhaps, were
a little blind when his case was called
to take that life away which He gave.
He will be judged by God because God
told him that He would judge him on
how well he kept His Ten Command-
ments.

The inmate of a penal institution
should logically, therefore, turn to God
since he belongs to God and his human
friends have failed.

Hypocrisy, according to Webster, is
the practice of feigning to be what one
is not.

When a man stays away from the
public service of the religion he profess-
es, he is a hypocrite, because he is feign-
ing that he does not belong to the re-
ligion he professes. He tells the world
that he believes in God and he feigns
not to believe in Him by not keeping
His Commandment, ‘‘Remember thou
shalt keep holy the Sabbath Day.’’"

Sweeping the Country

Two easy ones presented below;
look on last page if you
get stuck

Newspaper editors on the daily papers
are always endeavoring to uncover some
scheme to act as a tonic for their jaded
readers. We have witnessed the ‘‘limer-
ick wave’’, the ‘‘crossword puzzle fad’’,
and now the ‘‘cryptogram craze’’ is
rapidly coming to the fore.

The method of solving the cryptograms
is simple. We readily note on the printed
page the frequent occurance of certain
letters and letter combinations. ‘‘The’’
and ‘‘and’’ are the three letter words
appearing most frequently. The vowels
""e, a, i, and o’’ and the consonants ‘‘t,
s, r, and l’’ are the individual letters
which take precedence over the other let-
ters of the alphabet.

After these key words are inserted
in the cryptogram, others immediately
suggest themselves. When ‘‘e’’ is the
second last letter of a word, ‘‘d’’ or
“r"" immediately suggest themselves un-
til the meaning of the puzzle gradually
unfolds. Anyway, below are a couple of
easy ones. If you get stuck, look on the
back page for the answers.

Draws and Decision
on Fight Card

Datch Morgan, Rebel Hogan
and Slugger Mc Guire land
K.O.’s on June 16

PRIMO CARNERA LOSES

Three knockouts featured the second
boxing card at the House on June 16.
In the other bouts, two draws and a
decision resulted. While the famed ‘‘Bat-
tle Royal’? again failed to materialize,
the show was warmly received and ac-
tion was never wanting at any time
during the course of the program.

Dutch Morgan, rangy slugger from
12-1 Gallery, stole the show with his
second consecutive knockout, this one
coming at the expense of Dick Pike.
Always on the offensive, Morgan rushed
Pike from the outset, but Pike managed
to weather a wild flurry and slow Dutch
up a bit before the end of the first
round. It was inevitable that the match
would not go the limit from the outset,
and Pike wilted under the two fisted
attack by Morgan in the second round.

Rebel Hogan, a fast punching gum-
chewing workman, gained a technical
K.O. over Phil Cavan in the fourth bout
of the day. Hogan was a smooth worker
and shot his left and right with light-
ning rapidity. Cavan made a go of it
from the start but could not weather the
Rebel’s rush in the third heat. A right
to the head, followed by a cross did the
trick.

The match between Slugger McGuire
and Spike McCann came to a rapid and
unfortunate end in the first minute
when McGuire clipped the latter with a
terrifig right to the head that paralysed
McCann. The latter had no control over
his muscles, whatsoever, and for a mom-
ent it was feared that the injuries might
be permanent. McCann recovered a few
minutes after he was carried to his corn-
er, however.

The match which caught the fancy
of the spectators was the opener between
Primo Carnera (every bit of 103 pounds
net) and dusky Ace Clark. Using the
sixteen ounce gloves, the two paper-
weights wore themselves out in the first
round.

The crowd was in an uproar from the
minute the two battlers entered the ring
until Clark copped the three round de-
cision. However, the two boys put on a
better fight than some of the others
seen thus far. They tried every minute
and Primo hit the canvas several times
after stopping some af the Ace’s none
too gentle wallops. There was no ques-
tion about the decision, Clark knowing
a little too much and punching harder
than Primo.

Joey Freeman and Charley Chase
went three rounds to a draw, while Batt
Donald also went the distance with Bill
Murphy in a dead heat. Freeman had
the edge in the opening round but Char-
ley came back with a nice attack in the
closing cantos to earn a ‘‘good’’ draw.
The other deadlock was spotty in places,
but the boys crowded enough action into
the three heats to make it interesting.

Father Farley and Jimmy, the local
matchmaker, refereed the bouts and held
them ‘in check without any trouble.

Bugs Golden and Godfrey took a bow
between fights. The two boys will battle
it out in the first six round bout of the
year on July 4. It should be a mighty
interesting battle between the two heavy-
weights. At the same time, it was an-
nounced that efforts were being made
to secure Vinee Dundee to referee the
holiday card."

Kid Harry and Dutch Morgan tab
K.O.’s, while Bobby Scotten
gets decision

With the crowd in good spirits, thanks
to a pie-eating contest and some pretty
good vocal and orchestra selections, the
opening fight card of the season went
over with a bang on Memorial Day.

Batt Aggie and Frankie Mayo stole
the show with a blistering three round
scrap in the final bout of the card,
while Bobby Scotten, Kid Harry, and
Dutch Morgan were right behind with
nice performances.

Mayo’s defeat was rather a surprise
in as much ag he carried a good out-
side reputation into the ring with him.
Frankie started out hammer and tongs
after Batt, who looked hopelessly out-
classed in the first round. Aggie started
getting the range in the second and a
last minute rush swept Mayo off his
feet and evened the bout. There was no
question about the decision. when Batt
got off a flurry of telling blows in the
third canto.

Kid Harry knocked out Pat York in
another upset after a spectacular battle,
while Dutch Morgan sent Lefty. Kline
to the canvas with a two-fisted storm in
the first minute of the opening round.
Scotten showed plenty as he hammered
out a three round decision over Slug
Yam in the other high-spot.

K.O. Chester and Slug McGuire mixed
plenty of action into the first two rounds,
but tired rapidly in the closing session.
The bout was called a draw. An un-
fortunate ending to the other half of the
double wind-up came in the second round
when Teddy Dix fouled Kid Yellow
after outpointing him all the way."

"""The Best Outdoor Exhibition I have Ever Seen"" --Mr. Idell",Unknown,Grate-Phil News,,1934,7,3,1,5,3,1999.011.038GratePhilNewsVerso.jpg,,item,"“The Best Outdoor Exhibition
I Have Ever Seen’’-- Mr. Idell

“It was my privilege to see one of
the finest exhibitions of outdoor play
that I have ever seen.’’ That is the way
A. Provost Idell, known throughout the
country as ‘‘The Father of Volley Ball’’,
commented on the game which the Bio
courtmen lost to North Branch Y.M.C.A.
recently.

“I haye seen better indoor teams per-
form, but the men at this institution
certainly acquitted themselves wonder-
fully in the first three games that day.
I thought the ""Y"" team was going to
lose after those first two reverses.""

Mr. Idell is a member of the Hxecu-
tive Commitise of the United States
Volley Ball. Association and physical
director at th Navy Y.M.C.A, in Phila-
delphia. He tightly deserves the title of
""Father of Volley Ball"", judging from
the short sketh of him in Spaulding's
official volley ball rule book.

The sketch reads, ""He has partici-
pated in more than 10,000 games of
volleyball from 1910 to 1932, and has
been a spectator or referee in 4,000
other games. He had the opportunity of
piloting the Germantown Y.M.C.A from
1912 to 1919, during which time they
never lost a series, winning 750 games
and losing 75, and from 1918 to 1919
made a record of 125 consecutive vic-
tories.""

It was evident to anyone watching
Mr. Idell officiating in the game between
the ‘‘Y"" and the House that he knew
the game backwards and forwards. Fouls
that he called on the boys were never
known to exist, but the book said ae
do, so—!

Mr. Idell came in again on June 21
and gave the boys instructions in the
fine points of the game for an hour and
a half. It was the first time that any of
us ever dreamed that volleyball was
worked out to a mathematical science,
but Mr. Idell has done just that.

After showing the boys the fine points,
they tried them out in two practice
games and a general all around improve-
ment was immediately apparent.

There is only one bad feature about
Mr. Idell’s instructions. It is now gen-
erally conceded that the local sextette
ranks with the best in the State of
Pennsylvania — a record made despite
the handicaps of inexperience, Where
will they get a team to give the boys
called ""fine points"" down to perfection?
Looks like the only thing standing be-
tween the boys and the National Cham-
pionship is the fact that they will. not
bring the Nationals to 2107 Fairmount
Avenue!

Incidently, Mr. Idell asked Mr. Gern-
ey for a picture of the local team for
publication in the National Volleyball
Guide. This is the annual publication of
events in that section of the program
the United States Volley Ball Asgsocia-
tion, and it includes team records, rules
and helpful suggestions to beginners."

F. Rip’s single in the seventh inning
enabled the All-Stars to slip through
with a 2-1 victory over the Rangers and
extend their winning streak to four at
Graterford recently. The blow broke up
a neat hurling duel between Johnny and
Antosh, for the visitors.

The Farm nine broke a scoreless tie
in the fifth when J. Rip crossed the
plate, but the Rangers tied it up in the
seventh on hits by Jakeson and Antosh.

canto. Meehan pumped a single and F.
Whitey walked to put men on first and
second. Meehan romped home with the
deciding tally on Rip’s one bagger.

Johnny hurled brilliantly for the All-
Stars, fanning eleven batters and per-
mitting only four hits. J. Rip led the
attack for the victors with three hits,
while Meehan, F. Rip, J. Reds and
Johnny each chimed in with two.

Irish and Gyp Downey started against
Penn A.C. and romped away with the
opening game, 15-4.

The second game was merely a repe-
tition, the count being 15-4 again, with
both teams standing pat on their lineups.
The Pennacs perked up in their play
when Doc, Babs, and Chester entered
the tilt as substitutes and managed to
garner a dozen points before bowing,
15-12. Herman Ringler led the visitors
with a brilliant individual display, but
the all-around play of the locals was
too much for them.

With the match already clinched, the
House simply toyed with Pennac in the.
last game and galloped to a 15-9 de-
cision.

The victory, in addition to coming at
the expense of one of the best all-
around athletic clubs in Philadelphia,
was also noteworthy in as much.as Big
Slim was unable to see action on account
of his Lumbago.

Big Slim had been the tower of
strength in the House offense, but the
manner in which the Locals romped
away with the first set, alleviated all
fears the boys had over his absence.

Herm Ringler was by far the out-
standing individual on the court. He is
a former Northeast High School athlete, 
where he was captain of the swimming 
team, undefeated in Public High compe-
tition, and Interscholstic low board div-
ing champion for two straight years.
He is still the city's outstanding diving
star."

Nine in Ten Innings

Kelly and Whitey hit timely to
nudge Leathernecks, 9-8

After almost giving the game away in
the ninth and tenth innings, the All-
Stars kept on their winning way with
a three run rally in the latter part of
the tenth that nipped the U. S. Marines,
9-8 in a thrilling battle.

The Farm nine was leading 5-1 going
into the eighth inning, only to have the
Leathernecks shove over a brace of tal-
lies in that frame and come back with
three in the ninth and tie it up after
the Stars had also counted in the
eighth.

The game appeared hopelessly lost
when the Marines notched two more
markers in the tenth on Kilroys double
and three consecutive singles by Gear-
hart, Henry and Tolan.

Smitty singled and Eddie walked with
nobody out in the last half of the tenth
to give the Stars a new lease on life,
out on rollers to Sullivan at third.
Whitey got one of the runs back with
a solid single that chased in Smitty and
after Willey walked to fill the bases,
Kelly drilled one through the infield to
send in Hddie and Whitey with the
tying and winning counters.

Meehan continued his murderous hit-
ting, knocking off four straight bingles,
with Kelly getting two besides that
game winning single in the tenth. Every
member of the All-Star nine had a hand
in the hitmaking, however, with the ex-
eeption.of Frank and See Mack,
who walked.

The Marines were also in a hitting
mood, hammering Ray and Nixon for
fourteen safeties. Tolan, Gather, Sulli-
van, Edwards and Rusnick each had two,
while Shardie, Kilroy, Gearhart and
Henry chipped off one apiece.

House courtmen get careless after
taking opener by 15-1 count

After taking the first game by the
one-sided dount of 15-1, the House vol-
leyball team became careless and had
all kinds of trouble before Overbrook
A.C. bowed, 3-1.

The visitors, made up largely of Over-
brook High School stars, were hopeless-
ly outclassed by the locals in the opening
engagement, and spotted the House ten
points before they managed to break
into the scoring column.

Instead of continuing the romp, Over-
brook took advantage of numerous errors
and surprised everybody with a 15-8
victory in the second game.

With the regular team of Winters,
Chie Slim, Engle, Irish, Blackie and
Gyp back into action in the third game,
Overbrook continued its uphill battle
and made a go of it before bowing,
15-10. The last engagement was a dupli-
cation of the third game, with the House
winning by the same score.

Groff, Smith, Keehn, Herman, Rich-
ards, and Marshall comprised the Over-
brook sextette, Herman and Keehn were
the mainstays. Both of these boys played
on Overbrook’s championship basketball
team, with the former leading the Public
High League scorers.

After the volleyball game was over,
the visitors played two ten minute halves
of basketball against a white and a
colored team. Both of the abbreviated
tilts went to Overbrook by close scores.
The speed and passing of the Hilltoppers
drew considerable comment from the
spectators."
