Card for July 4

Holiday Program

HAM vs. “THE WONDER”

Six bouts and at least three novelty
sketches have been arranged for the an-
nual Fourth of July boxing program at
the House. While not wishing to detract
from the two previous cards, the holi-
day bill should be far the most interest
ing yet presented.

Not only will there be plenty of com-
edy, but a top notch fight program and
possibly one or two celebrities to help
out at the ringside.

The long awaited bout between Bugs
Golden and Godfrey, and a return go be-
tween Frankie Mayo and Slug Aggie are
the double wind-up features on the all
star card.

Bugs has fought the best in the land
in outside rings and toured with the one
and only Jack Dempsey for a spell.
Although he stopped fighting a little
over a year ago and is rapidly topping
the 200-mark, Bugs still has plenty of
his old time skill.

Godfrey is up around the 195-mark
and is purely a local boy. He is one of
the best fighters ever to be seen in the
House and has won every one of his
fights with the exception of one with
George Kuchini in his second start.

""I’m in to fight—give and take any-
thing—It all depends on the other fel-
low,’’ said Golden up in the Chapel
recently, while Godfrey vows he will
‘‘give him all he wants and take a
little in return too.’’ What a battle this
promises to be!

Of the Frankie Mayo-Slug Aggie tiff,
little need be said. This duo captured
first prize in the opening show with three
blistering rounds that had the crowd in
an uproar from the outset. Aggie put
a big dent in Mayo’s outside reputation,
but the swarthy hued serapper is bent
on turning the tables.

The supporting card has several bouts
which might upset the dope and, walk
away with some of the choice prizes.
Joe Sharkey, making his first start in
here will take on Dick Pike. Dutch Mor-
gan was all set to try for his third
straight knockout against Pike, but was
forced to withdraw when he sprained an
ankle playing basketball. Pike showed
promise in his tussle with Morgan and
will probably give Sharkey a severe test.

The gum-chewing Rebel Hogan, who
caught the crowd’s faney with a clever
two-fisted attack against Phil Cavan,
takes on the veteran K.O. Pat. The lat-
ter is a veteran of many ring battles,
but has been inactive for several years.
Don’t be at all surprised if this one
finishes near the top in the awards.

Suitease Yorkie makes his first start
of the year against Young Harry, who
is out to repeat the K.O. win he tabbed
in his first start against Pat York in
the opening card. The ever laughing
Yorkie has a score of local fights under
his belt and can handle himself with
the best of them. Another interesting
bout, to say the least! In the third bout
Jim Brooks makes his first start against
the veteran Yam Flowers, who dropped
his first bout to Bobby Scotten.

But the prize bout of them all comes
just before the double wind-up, when
the incomparable Ham stacks up against
the ‘‘Unknown Wonder’’. The pride of
the Armour Belt had all kinds of trouble
securing an opponent, but ‘‘Unknown’’
was finally coaxed into the match. What
a slugger this boy Ham is! What foot-
work! It’s collossal! Little Jimmy will)
probably stake his reputation as a ref-
eree in this tussle, the others will be
handled by outside men."

School attendance at Philadelphia is
picking up again. There were 105 men
in school last Wednesday.

Phil Cain, teacher at Philadelphia, is
recovering from his fourth operation and
visited the school the other day in a
wheel chair, Says he just can’ stay
away. Phil has complete use of his arm
and hand now and we will be glad to
see him back at his desk again.

Just wait until you see the Landscap-
ing job the students and faculty are
doing around the school building at
Graterford. We'll neutralize the unsight-
liness of those ugly coal piles yet.

Can you imagine it? Over 100 men in
eyening school at Graterford last Wed-
nesday night (102 to be exact). And
they told us no one would come to night
school these nice summer evenings with
baseball and movies to pull them away.

Four hundred baby chicks in the
Brooder House; fifteen flourishing vege-
table garden plots and several Landscape
gardening projects! How’s that for a
going program of projects in Agricul-
tural Education at Graterford?

Thirty-five students in the afternoon
classes at Philadelphia. Thirty-five men
giving up part of yard-out to go to
school. Well, we will admit we hardly
expected it but it sure is gratifying to
know that our service is appreciated to
that extent.

Two more office clerks placed from
school students this month. Little by lit-

MATCHES

GAMES
Won 21 — Lost 6

All good things must come to an end!
Yes, even the winning streak of the
House volleyball team. The locals came
within a hair of defending its streak
successfully and also creating one of the
biggest upsets in Philadelphia volley-
ball circles before losing, however.

A determined rally in the last three
games finally gave the North Branch
Y.M.C.A. a 3-2 victory over the Light
and Dark Blue team.

The visitors: have the reputation of
being the perennial champions of Phila-
delphia and in last winter’s National
Championship play at the University of
Tennessee, finished runner-up to Chica-
go and Houston, Texas. Several years
ago, and with practically the same team,
the ""Y"" sextette won the National
Championship.

After a shaky start in which the House
gave the visitors more points on faults
than on actual errors, the locals pulled
themselves together and lifted the first
game out of the fire, 15-11. What a
surprise that was!

In that tilt the Dark and Light Blue
team did not ‘‘rotate’’ as is customary
in outside play, but the boys played the
visitors at their own game in the second
engagement and again won out, dupli-
cating the count of the opener.

The work of Big Slim, out of ecompe-
tition in the two previous matches on
account of lumbago, was a revelation.
Slim made almost impossible shots and
made the ‘‘Y’’ players look foolish on
several occasions

The House team appeared to be head-
ing for victory in straight games when
it got away to an early lead in the third,
and what would have been the deciding
match. Needing only two points for
victory, two misplays in the back court
jand nice shots by Schuck and Wurz-
boch for the ""Y"", enabled North
Branch to eke out a 15-13 triumph.

Winters, Babs, Stucky, Engle and
Buddy saw action in place of the regu-
lars in this and the fourth game, and
after dropping the 15-13 setto, folded
up in the fourth and were outclassed,
15-2.

The regulars swung back into action
in the fifth and all important game, but
could not halt the relentless attack of 
the visitors. With the final outcome in 
the balance, North Branch romped to a
15-4 triumph.

Chi Slim, Big Slim, Engle, Irish,
Blackie and Gyp made up the starting
lineup for the House, while Scheam,
Spealler, Tidbolt, Hall, Wurzboch and
Schuck represented North Branch. Orn-
jer, Bodie, Strobel and Satinsky also saw
action for the victors.

Mr. Idell, known throughout the coun-
try as the ‘‘Father of Volleyball"",
refereed the tilt."

with Six Run Rally

Farm nine chases Simmons
Powhida to gain a 10- 8
victory

Showins absolutely no regard tor the
highly vaunted Penn Athletic Club nine,
composed of some of the best collegiate
athletes turned out in the East, the All-
Star nine at the Farm clustered six runs
in the seventh inning to turn back ie
Thomas’ club, 10-8.

Trailing 7-4 in the lucky seventh,
Whitey ’s single chased Ray home and
F. Rip’s double tabbed Meehan and H.
Whitey with the tying runs. Coach
Buck’s club took the lead a moment
later when Johnny Reds laced out a two
bagger that sent F. Rip scampering to
the plate, “and before the inning was
over, Lefty's beautiful bunt allowed
Kelly and John Reds to sneak home
with the ninth and tenth runs.

Simmons was on the hill when the
All-Stars started golfing the apple and
Johnny Powhida, former University of
Pennsylvania great, went in to squelch
the uprising.. After four of his pitches
were sent back to him faster than he
threw them plateward, Carson Thompson
ascended the knoll.

Thompson, former Temple University
star, just recently garnered his 29th
consecutive victory while hurling for
Stonehurst A.A. and showed plenty in
the eighth, but it was too late to mean
anything.

The first six men on the All-Star team
accounted for all of the Stars? bingles,
Meehan and J. Reds leading with three,
H. Whitey, F. Rip and Lefty each get-
ting two, and Kelly one. F, Rip, Kelly,
Lefty and J. Reds had two baggers and
the latter also had a triple.

Rolfe ‘‘Swede’’ Carlsten, who led the
Intercollegiate League batters and earned
a tryout in the International League
after graduating from Penn, led Penn
A.C. with a long home run and a triple.
Walt Hddowes took what was left of the
batting laurels with a double and two
singles.

Kelly played a beautiful game at
short for the Stars, handling nine chane-
es without a boot, while Jimmy Dough-
erty did the best work afield for Penn
A.C. with five chances. Berry and Ray
handled the pitching assignment for the
victors, and although touched for thirteen
bingles, kept them well scattered.

It was only the third defeat for Penn
A.C. and the first reverse since playing
semi-professional ball. Temple University
with Hddie Cramer, the star southpaw
who is now with the Washington Sena-
tors hurling both games, administered
both previous defeats. In addition to
turning back Pennsylvania and other
leading colleges in these parts, the elub-
men have been sweeping through the
best sandlot teams around these parts.

Farm nine will attempt to start
new streak against
Reading club

The powerful Ajax A.C. of Reading,
Pa, will be the opposition for the All-
Star nine and wind up a full day of
athletics at the Farm on the Fourth of
July. The ball game will be played in
the afternoon and a large crowd of spec-
tators is expected for the fuss.

The Farm tossers have been going at
a merry clip this season and have built
up a mice record. They have captured
eight of the ten games played to date,
excluding the game with the Olney Aces
Saturday.

Coach Buck’s nine started off with
four straight wins, defeating Skippack,
2-1, 45th Ward, 9-4, Roxborough, 17-9,
and the Parkway Baking Company, 23-6.
Quakertown broke the slate with a 5-4
triumph in a listless game, but the All- —
Stars got started on another streak with-
out wasting any time.

Hampden, the same team yen de-
feated Quakertown 12-4, suffered a 21-6
shellacking, the Moree lost 9-8, Penn
A.C. bowed, 10-8, and the Rangers lost
a 2-1 squeeze. Kennett Square had the
honor of being the second team to de-
feat the locals, turning in an 8-6 card.

The Ajax club will lineup with Clay,
Burns and Remley in the outfield and
Rohrback and Mancuso forming the bat-
tery. The infield, starting at first and
swinging around the diamond, will be
made up of Brown, Painter, Beard and
Knowleski. Ertel, Klingaman, Walters,
Huzzard, Strunk and Herman are the
spares who will probably see action be-
for the game is over."

11,Religion and the Inmate,Unknown,Grate-Phil News,,1934,7,3,1,5,2,GratePhilNews-2.jpg,,item,"Religion and the Inmate

Figures tell us that about 25% of the
religious services regularly. That figure
may be a little high for the Hastern
State Penitentiary, but whether 25% is
the correct figure for this or any other
institution is not the point under dis-
cussion. We know that\ the vast majority
of the inmates of our institutions: do not
attend religious services.

A very insignificant: few of our in-
mates deny that they have any 
convictions. Most of them admit belong-
ing to some denomination. Since they
belong to some Church, it would be the
logical thing for them to attend services
held by their Church behind the walls.

The popular excuses in jail for the
man not attending his denominational
service are, that he never attended when
he was free, so why attend now; and
secondly, that only the hypocrite attends
religious services while under confine-
ment. These excuses, if they may be
called such, are the standard ones and
the man who would be a real convict
tries to live down to these standards.
The carelessness for religious service,
the indifference toward the practice of
his religious tenents that marked the
free man, are still dominant in the man
incarcerated, which would tend to show
a lack of moral reform. Had he been
strict in his attendance at Church, had
he observed carefully the spirit and let-
ter of the dogmas of his faith, he would
never have fallen into crime. Religion
precludes crime.

The attendance at Church Services is
a publie attestation that the one pres-
ent believes in God and has presented
himself at the service to join his prayer
with that of his brother. By his very
presence at Church he tells the world
that he acknowledges that he believes
in God and his Creator, his Redeemer
and his Judge.

The man in jail has lost one of the
dearest possessions that he has ... his
liberty. He therefore needs something—
he wants something. It has been his sad
experience that the moment his troubles
overtook him, his so-called friends fled
him like rats from a sinking ship. Hyen
his relatives turned away from him be-
cause he brought the family name into
disrepute.

The agencies of Justice perhaps, were
a little blind when his case was called
to take that life away which He gave.
He will be judged by God because God
told him that He would judge him on
how well he kept His Ten Command-
ments.

The inmate of a penal institution
should logically, therefore, turn to God
since he belongs to God and his human
friends have failed.

Hypocrisy, according to Webster, is
the practice of feigning to be what one
is not.

When a man stays away from the
public service of the religion he profess-
es, he is a hypocrite, because he is feign-
ing that he does not belong to the re-
ligion he professes. He tells the world
that he believes in God and he feigns
not to believe in Him by not keeping
His Commandment, ‘‘Remember thou
shalt keep holy the Sabbath Day.’’"

Sweeping the Country

Two easy ones presented below;
look on last page if you
get stuck

Newspaper editors on the daily papers
are always endeavoring to uncover some
scheme to act as a tonic for their jaded
readers. We have witnessed the ‘‘limer-
ick wave’’, the ‘‘crossword puzzle fad’’,
and now the ‘‘cryptogram craze’’ is
rapidly coming to the fore.

The method of solving the cryptograms
is simple. We readily note on the printed
page the frequent occurance of certain
letters and letter combinations. ‘‘The’’
and ‘‘and’’ are the three letter words
appearing most frequently. The vowels
""e, a, i, and o’’ and the consonants ‘‘t,
s, r, and l’’ are the individual letters
which take precedence over the other let-
ters of the alphabet.

After these key words are inserted
in the cryptogram, others immediately
suggest themselves. When ‘‘e’’ is the
second last letter of a word, ‘‘d’’ or
“r"" immediately suggest themselves un-
til the meaning of the puzzle gradually
unfolds. Anyway, below are a couple of
easy ones. If you get stuck, look on the
back page for the answers.

Oh Lord in Heaven strengthen my will

To attend to my own business.
I beseech of Thee wisdom to enable

Be more tolerant of my fellowmen.
To stop looking for faults and to see the

Each day, Father, put it in my heart
to do
At least one good deed in behalf of a

Teach me that there is good in every

Make me realize that more can be gained 
by
A sincere smile, than a superior and

Attitude.
Instill in me the desire for wholesome

And to ‘‘do unto others, as I would have
others do unto me.’’
To speak well only of others, and to
refrain
From criticizing the indiscretions of my

Draws and Decision
on Fight Card

Datch Morgan, Rebel Hogan
and Slugger Mc Guire land
K.O.’s on June 16

PRIMO CARNERA LOSES

Three knockouts featured the second
boxing card at the House on June 16.
In the other bouts, two draws and a
decision resulted. While the famed ‘‘Bat-
tle Royal’? again failed to materialize,
the show was warmly received and ac-
tion was never wanting at any time
during the course of the program.

Dutch Morgan, rangy slugger from
12-1 Gallery, stole the show with his
second consecutive knockout, this one
coming at the expense of Dick Pike.
Always on the offensive, Morgan rushed
Pike from the outset, but Pike managed
to weather a wild flurry and slow Dutch
up a bit before the end of the first
round. It was inevitable that the match
would not go the limit from the outset,
and Pike wilted under the two fisted
attack by Morgan in the second round.

Rebel Hogan, a fast punching gum-
chewing workman, gained a technical
K.O. over Phil Cavan in the fourth bout
of the day. Hogan was a smooth worker
and shot his left and right with light-
ning rapidity. Cavan made a go of it
from the start but could not weather the
Rebel’s rush in the third heat. A right
to the head, followed by a cross did the
trick.

The match between Slugger McGuire
and Spike McCann came to a rapid and
unfortunate end in the first minute
when McGuire clipped the latter with a
terrifig right to the head that paralysed
McCann. The latter had no control over
his muscles, whatsoever, and for a mom-
ent it was feared that the injuries might
be permanent. McCann recovered a few
minutes after he was carried to his corn-
er, however.

The match which caught the fancy
of the spectators was the opener between
Primo Carnera (every bit of 103 pounds
net) and dusky Ace Clark. Using the
sixteen ounce gloves, the two paper-
weights wore themselves out in the first
round.

The crowd was in an uproar from the
minute the two battlers entered the ring
until Clark copped the three round de-
cision. However, the two boys put on a
better fight than some of the others
seen thus far. They tried every minute
and Primo hit the canvas several times
after stopping some af the Ace’s none
too gentle wallops. There was no ques-
tion about the decision, Clark knowing
a little too much and punching harder
than Primo.

Joey Freeman and Charley Chase
went three rounds to a draw, while Batt
Donald also went the distance with Bill
Murphy in a dead heat. Freeman had
the edge in the opening round but Char-
ley came back with a nice attack in the
closing cantos to earn a ‘‘good’’ draw.
The other deadlock was spotty in places,
but the boys crowded enough action into
the three heats to make it interesting.

Father Farley and Jimmy, the local
matchmaker, refereed the bouts and held
them ‘in check without any trouble.

Bugs Golden and Godfrey took a bow
between fights. The two boys will battle
it out in the first six round bout of the
year on July 4. It should be a mighty
interesting battle between the two heavy-
weights. At the same time, it was an-
nounced that efforts were being made
to secure Vinee Dundee to referee the
holiday card."

Kid Harry and Dutch Morgan tab
K.O.’s, while Bobby Scotten
gets decision

With the crowd in good spirits, thanks
to a pie-eating contest and some pretty
good vocal and orchestra selections, the
opening fight card of the season went
over with a bang on Memorial Day.

Batt Aggie and Frankie Mayo stole
the show with a blistering three round
scrap in the final bout of the card,
while Bobby Scotten, Kid Harry, and
Dutch Morgan were right behind with
nice performances.

Mayo’s defeat was rather a surprise
in as much ag he carried a good out-
side reputation into the ring with him.
Frankie started out hammer and tongs
after Batt, who looked hopelessly out-
classed in the first round. Aggie started
getting the range in the second and a
last minute rush swept Mayo off his
feet and evened the bout. There was no
question about the decision. when Batt
got off a flurry of telling blows in the
third canto.

Kid Harry knocked out Pat York in
another upset after a spectacular battle,
while Dutch Morgan sent Lefty. Kline
to the canvas with a two-fisted storm in
the first minute of the opening round.
Scotten showed plenty as he hammered
out a three round decision over Slug
Yam in the other high-spot.

K.O. Chester and Slug McGuire mixed
plenty of action into the first two rounds,
but tired rapidly in the closing session.
The bout was called a draw. An un-
fortunate ending to the other half of the
double wind-up came in the second round
when Teddy Dix fouled Kid Yellow
after outpointing him all the way."

I Have Ever Seen’’-- Mr. Idell

“It was my privilege to see one of
the finest exhibitions of outdoor play
that I have ever seen.’’ That is the way
A. Provost Idell, known throughout the
country as ‘‘The Father of Volley Ball’’,
commented on the game which the Bio
courtmen lost to North Branch Y.M.C.A.
recently.

“I haye seen better indoor teams per-
form, but the men at this institution
certainly acquitted themselves wonder-
fully in the first three games that day.
I thought the ""Y"" team was going to
lose after those first two reverses.""

Mr. Idell is a member of the Hxecu-
tive Commitise of the United States
Volley Ball. Association and physical
director at th Navy Y.M.C.A, in Phila-
delphia. He tightly deserves the title of
""Father of Volley Ball"", judging from
the short sketh of him in Spaulding's
official volley ball rule book.

The sketch reads, ""He has partici-
pated in more than 10,000 games of
volleyball from 1910 to 1932, and has
been a spectator or referee in 4,000
other games. He had the opportunity of
piloting the Germantown Y.M.C.A from
1912 to 1919, during which time they
never lost a series, winning 750 games
and losing 75, and from 1918 to 1919
made a record of 125 consecutive vic-
tories.""

It was evident to anyone watching
Mr. Idell officiating in the game between
the ‘‘Y"" and the House that he knew
the game backwards and forwards. Fouls
that he called on the boys were never
known to exist, but the book said ae
do, so—!

Mr. Idell came in again on June 21
and gave the boys instructions in the
fine points of the game for an hour and
a half. It was the first time that any of
us ever dreamed that volleyball was
worked out to a mathematical science,
but Mr. Idell has done just that.

After showing the boys the fine points,
they tried them out in two practice
games and a general all around improve-
ment was immediately apparent.

There is only one bad feature about
Mr. Idell’s instructions. It is now gen-
erally conceded that the local sextette
ranks with the best in the State of
Pennsylvania — a record made despite
the handicaps of inexperience, Where
will they get a team to give the boys
called ""fine points"" down to perfection?
Looks like the only thing standing be-
tween the boys and the National Cham-
pionship is the fact that they will. not
bring the Nationals to 2107 Fairmount
Avenue!

Incidently, Mr. Idell asked Mr. Gern-
ey for a picture of the local team for
publication in the National Volleyball
Guide. This is the annual publication of
events in that section of the program
the United States Volley Ball Asgsocia-
tion, and it includes team records, rules
and helpful suggestions to beginners."

with a 2-1 victory over the Rangers and
extend their winning streak to four at
Graterford recently. The blow broke up
a neat hurling duel between Johnny and

seventh on hits by Jakeson and Antosh.
That set the stage for the winning up-

canto. Meehan pumped a single and F.
Whitey walked to put men on first and
second. Meehan romped home with the
deciding tally on Rip’s one bagger.

Johnny hurled brilliantly for the All-

mitting only four hits. J. Rip led the
attack for the victors with three hits,

without any great trouble, the House

triumphs for the season, turning back
the Penn Athletic Club courtmen, 4-0.

The downtown clubmen were reputed
once the local team got into action the
visitors were slowed down to a walk.
Jimmy Winters, Chi Slim, Engle, Blackie,
Irish and Gyp Downey started against
Penn A.C. and romped away with the

The second game was merely a repe-
tition, the count being 15-4 again, with
both teams standing pat on their lineups.
The Pennacs perked up in their play
when Doc, Babs, and Chester entered
the tilt as substitutes and managed to
garner a dozen points before bowing,
15-12. Herman Ringler led the visitors
with a brilliant individual display, but

around athletic clubs in Philadelphia,
was also noteworthy in as much.as Big
Slim was unable to see action on account
of his Lumbago.

Big Slim had been the tower of
strength in the House offense, but the
manner in which the Locals romped
away with the first set, alleviated all
fears the boys had over his absence.

Herm Ringler was by far the out-
standing individual on the court. He is
a former Northeast High School athlete, 
where he was captain of the swimming 
team, undefeated in Public High compe-
tition, and Interscholstic low board div-
ing champion for two straight years.

Nine in Ten Innings

Kelly and Whitey hit timely to
nudge Leathernecks, 9-8

After almost giving the game away in
the ninth and tenth innings, the All-
Stars kept on their winning way with
a three run rally in the latter part of
the tenth that nipped the U. S. Marines,
9-8 in a thrilling battle.

The Farm nine was leading 5-1 going
into the eighth inning, only to have the
Leathernecks shove over a brace of tal-
lies in that frame and come back with
three in the ninth and tie it up after
the Stars had also counted in the
eighth.

The game appeared hopelessly lost
when the Marines notched two more
markers in the tenth on Kilroys double
and three consecutive singles by Gear-
hart, Henry and Tolan.

Smitty singled and Eddie walked with
nobody out in the last half of the tenth
to give the Stars a new lease on life,
out on rollers to Sullivan at third.
Whitey got one of the runs back with
a solid single that chased in Smitty and
after Willey walked to fill the bases,
Kelly drilled one through the infield to
send in Hddie and Whitey with the
tying and winning counters.

Meehan continued his murderous hit-
ting, knocking off four straight bingles,
with Kelly getting two besides that
game winning single in the tenth. Every
member of the All-Star nine had a hand
in the hitmaking, however, with the ex-
eeption.of Frank and See Mack,
who walked.

The Marines were also in a hitting
mood, hammering Ray and Nixon for
fourteen safeties. Tolan, Gather, Sulli-
van, Edwards and Rusnick each had two,
while Shardie, Kilroy, Gearhart and
Henry chipped off one apiece.

After taking the first game by the

all kinds of trouble before Overbrook

43,Centralized Radio System About 75 Percent Complete,Unknown,Pen Points,,1934,2,14,1,1,1,1934.02.14.01_PenPoints.jpg,,item,"Centralized Radio System
About 75 Percent Complete

Three National Chains and
Local Station to Furnish 
Programs All Day

Almost 75 percent of the work 
has been completed on the radio
installation project at present,
with RCA engineers hoping that
individual reception will be avail-
able sometime early in March.

The piping conduits and drilling
necessary to reach each cell has all
been completed, while the Control
Units and wiring are also ready
for immediate use. More than 104,-
000 feet of armored cable has been 
used in the gigantic program and
130,000 feet of wire will be drawn
through the conduits before the 
system is completed.

This project is an outgrowth of
the development of radio itself, but
it was only within the last two 
months that the program began to 
formulate concretely. 

The general system of installa-
tion, better known as the Four 
Channel Centralized Radio System,
specifies four ""racks,"" each weigh-
ing almost 600 pounds, with 800
control boxes running from the 
four main channels. Provision has
been made for 1200 outlets direct
to each cell from these control box-
es. 

Three nationwide broadcasting 
systems, and one prominent local
station, will furnish radio programs
every hour of the day. 

Through this method of central-
ized receiving, the best available 
programs at present, can be re-
ceived by each individual at the 
absolute minimum of effort. The
station selection remains entirely
at the choice of the receiver. A
simple regulation of the cell con-
trol boxes will change the program 
immediately to any one of the four
different broadcasting organiza-
tions. 

The cell control boxes will con-
tain nothing more than an ordin-
ary panel with a switch and four
""knots."" Each of the latter will 
be designated to represent one of
the broadcasting systems, and a 
movement of the switch to another 
""knot will immediately change 
the program being received.

Two of the control boxes will 
be installed in each cell. Each set 
of ear-phones will be equipped with
ten feet of wire to permit a great
deal of freedom in movement.
These control boxes lead directly
into the outlet boxes on the out-
side of the cells. The latter, in
turn, go directly to the central re-
ceiving apparatus. 

The ""racks,"" which are being 
installed on the 7th Gallery, are
equally simple when it comes to 
operation. The station reception 
is brought about much in the same
manner as in an ordinary radio
set tuning.

By sealing the dial, no more reg-
ulation is necessary until the send-
ing station ceases to broadcast. At
that time an automatic switch shuts 
off the mechanism. No regulation 
whatsoever, is necessary once our
local receptors pick up the stations
for each of the four channels. 

The expense of radio reception 
is reduced to its absolute minimum 
according to engineers of the RCA 
Company. Outside of the initial 
expenditure, very little cost is nec-
essary to keep the extensive appar-
atus in working order. 

Instead of keeping an individual
receiving set in repair and purchas-
ing tubes and other incidentals, all 
this is done away with in the Cen-
tralized Receiving System. Both
the control boxes and the cell out-
lets contain nothing but simple 
standard parts, with necessary re-
pairs being insignificant in com-
parison to the up-keep of a single
set. Not only is the outlay and re-
pair costs virtually eliminated af-
ter the initial expenditure has been
made, but electrical disturbances 
are also tremendously reduced. The
volume control is likewise automat-
ic, insuring a constant tone regard-
less of outside interference and 
weather conditions. Cross talk, al-
so common in individual reception,
is another ""bugaboo"" that has been 
done away with.

The entire cost of the installa-
tion work will be taken care of by
the Prisoner's Welfare Fund, and
in this manner every member of 
the institution will have access to 
the daily radio programs."

RCA Engineers Hail System
as Best in the Penal
Institutions

According to L. P. Clark and 
Company, local agents for the RCA, 
the Centralized Radio System
which is now being installed in this
institution is the largest to be
found in any penal institution in
the United States.

The Centralized System is used
in such places as the Governor 
Clinton Hotel, Philadelphia Sav-
ings Fund Society Building, Jeffer-
son Medical College and numerous
other places, but the only manner
in which these commercial jobs dif-
fer from the local installation is a
trifling increase in power, and the 
substitution of amplifiers for head-
sets.

All of the equipment is approved
by the RCA and is complete in it-
self. The Antenna System is the
only one to be approved by the
U. S. Government at present for
ships and sea and at naval bases. 

The use of steel ""racks"" permits 
grounding of the radio chassis to
steel frames and thus eliminating
regeneration between radio chan-
nels and also unnecessary noise in-
terference. They also permit better 
ventilation to the mechanism and
naturally cause less depreciation.

At Ossining, N. Y., where a
similar system is installed, the 
""racks"" are the extent of the 
equipment, with the individual sets
being obtained according to the in-
mate selection. While provisions
are made to take care of as many 
outlets as we have here, the indivi-
dual purchase of sets places the 
price out of the reach of a good 
number of the men."
47,Vocational Education Taking Place of Shop Worn Theories,C.E. Heddes (Director of Education,Pen Points,,1934,2,14,1,1,,1934.02.14.01_PenPoints.jpg,,item,"Vocational Education Taking 
Place of Shop Worn Theories

In the past, Education was some-
thing that was looked upon as be-
ing compulsory; we had to take it;
it was ""supposed"" to be of some
value to us. Just what value, how-
ever, could not be determined very 
concretely.

Some people were of the opinion
that Education was necessary for
its cultural values. In other words,
we could not hope to be a success 
in life unless certain prescribed 
curriculums were mastered. By
undergoing this ordeal one was 
supposed to magically acquire the
where-with-all by which he could
secure an entrance to the more 
select circles in life. 

Some people took a broader view
of the general condition, and prob-
ably for the want of something 
even more indefinite, said that edu-
cation was vital for its social value/
Just what their concrete beliefs
were, no one knew. The doctrine
was exceedingly elastic—first to 
stretch this way, and then again to
stretch that.

At the same time, those indivi-
duals who prided themselves in
being ""practical,"" took an entire-
ly different view. Said they, ""Ed-
ucation is essential in training the 
man to fit the environment,"" but
in the same breath, used the latter 
term as something all-inclusive.

Regardless of overlapping be-
liefs these groups held, it is suffici-
ent to say that no one ever thought
of tying education to a job in any
manner except in a college where
one was supposed to specialize in 
such pursuits.

A marked change has taken 
place, however, in the past ten
years in the form of the Vocational
Education Movement—or, ""educa-
tion for a job."" In short, we have 
become a Nation going back to
school. Instead of classes being a 
recognition of one's limited educa-
tion, going to school is now the 
complimentary determination of 
one's progressive desire to keep up
to date.

Thus the school in this institution
aims to provide the tools for bet-
ter, pleasanter, and more harmon-
ious living, so that, those who can-
not now read or write their own
letters may be able to do this;
those who are not able to hold pos-
itions in the institution may qual-
ify for employment; and finally
those who have never prepared
themselves to hold a job may make 
that preparation here and be ready
for desirable employment on their 
return to society.

Parole Laws Given in Detail

Act of Assembly Covering 
Release and Violation set
forth to aid eligible

BOARD OF TRUSTEES' 
WORK ALSO RELATED

The dictionary defines the word 
parole thus: ""In penology, the re-
lease of a prisoner under promise 
not to violate the law; to release a 
prisoner on this word of honor to
observe certain conditions.""

The Act of Assembly, aproved 
the 10th day of May, A.D., 1909, in-
augurated the present system of 
release by Parole, as well as the 
penalty for violating parole. This
Act set up the minimum and max-
imum sentences, and the eligi-
bility of prisoners for release on
parole at the expiration of their
minimum sentence, subject to con-
ditions as laid down by law. Sub-
sequent Acts of Assembly have 
made it mandatory that a prisoner 
sentenced to a state penitentiary 
must have a minimum and a max-
imum sentence, and the minimum
setence shall not exceed one-half 
of the maximum sentence.

Parole, as it affects an inmate of
the Eastern State Penitentiary, 
can be divided into two distinct 
classifications: 
(A) Preliminary steps and procedure to-
ward obtaining a parole.
(B) Requirements and operation of the
Parole Laws as they affect a parole
prisoner.

Let us follow these two classifi-
cations closely, as it will solve many
of the perplexing questions con-
fronting every inmate as the time
draws near for his opportunity to 
make application for release on 
parole.

""A""—The Acts of Assembly set up
the procedure that shall be followed
in considering the applications. They
vest in the Board of Trustees of the 
State Penitentiaries the power and the 
duty of considering every inmate for
parole within a period of three months
prior to the expiration of his minimum
sentence, and making a recommendation
to the Governor as to whether such
convict shall be released on parole.

This recommendation must first be
sent to the Board of Pardons for ap-
proval. When, and if, the Board of 
Pardons approve the recommendation
of the Board of Trustees, then the 
Board of Pardons presents the recom-
mendation for release on parole to the
Governor. The Board of Pardons must
approve all recommendations for re-
lease on parole, or reparole, which
might be made by the Board of Trust-
ees of the Eastern State Penitentiary,
before they are presented to the Gover-
nor for his official action.

The Board of Pardons, by virtue of 
the fact that they must approve all 
recommendations for release on parole
to the Governor, have set up certain
requirements which they feel essential,
and in the absence of which they refuse 
to present the recommendation. These
requirements can be listed as follows:

1. An inmate must have a suitable, law-
abiding sponsor.
2. He must have a job or a good home to 
go to.
3. Lacking the job or home, he must have 
sufficient funds to enable him to be 
self-supporting for a reasonable length
of time in which to procure work for
himself. (Amount fixed by the Pardon
Board at approximately $150.00)
4. If the inmate is to be turned over to
other jurisdiction on detainer or other-
wise, and if he is to be deported.

The above requirements are set by 
the Board of Pardons, and not by the 
Board of Trustees. The requirements
of the Board of Trustees are set by 
law, but the Board of Pardons can insist 
on any requirement they see fit for 
what they think is the best interest of 
everyone concerned. It would be a 
waste of time for the Board of Trust-
ees of this institution to forward any
recommendation to the Bard of Par-
dons for approval, if there were not 
attached to the recommendation proof
of the fact that the requirements of 
the Board of Pardons had been met as
regards sponsor, work, home, etc. There
fore, no recommendation is forwarded
without the conditions of the Pardon
Board having first been met by the in-
mate eligible for parole. 

How can you fulfill the above condi-
tions? That is where the function of 
the Parole Department of the Eastern
State Penitentiary operates.

Approximately three months prior to
the expiration of an inmate's minimum
setnence he is given an Application for
Parole. On this applciation there is a 
space provided for the names and ad-
dresses of any persons who the inmate
feels might act as sponsor and/or em-
ployer for him if released on parole.
The Parole Department writes to the 
people mentioned asking them to act
in the capacity of sponsor or employer,
or both. The inmate should also write
to anyone he knows who he thinks will
assist him in this critical period.

The more people who are contacted 
in this manner the more opportunities 
are liable to be unearthed for sponsors
and possible offers of employment. Give
the Parole Officer the names of all pos-
sible friends or relatives, with their ad-
dresses, so he can write them all in 
your interest.

When any replies are received they 
are turned over to the Field Agents of 
the Department of Justice, who work
under the Board of Pardons. These
Field Agents investigate the offers made
in the letters, making a report of their
investigation, this report being for the
Board of Pardons. If the report is re-
turned satisfactory, and the Board of 
Trustees have approved the parole of 
any inmate subject to such satisfactory
report being received, then the recom-
mendation of the Board of Trusteres is 
forwarded to the Board of Pardons for 
approval. 

Of course, it is within the power of 
the Board of Trustees to refuse to rec-
commend any inmate for parole. Some
of the reasons that a parole might be
refused by the Board of Trustees are:

1. Bad institutional record, as regards con-
duct or work, or both.
2. Lengthy criminal record.
3. Antagonistic attitude, and lack of co-
operation with those you came in contact
with, as displayed during confinement.

After the recommendation of the 
Board of Trustees is forwarded to the
Board of Pardons it takes a little time
for the recommendation to come up for
consideration by that Board, and then
procuring the signed approval of the
Governor, sometimes taking as long as 
two or three weeks. For this reason it
is best to get after your prospective
sponsors and employers at least two or
three months prior to your eligible re-
lease date, so that the approved investi-
gation report and the recommendations
of the Board of Trustees can be in the 
hands of the Board of Pardons in suffi-
cient time to eliminate the possibility 
of any delay in your release.

Bear in mind at all times that the 
officials of this instittuion, and the of-
ficers in the Parole Department, are
interested in seeing that you are re-
leased when you are eligible for release,
and are ready to assit in any way pos-
sible. Naturally they cannot do the im-
possible, you must co-operate. Feel
free to ask them for any assistance, at
any time, in your problems.

""B""—Let us assume that your rec-
ommendation for parole has been ap-
proved by the Board of Pardons and
the Governor. You are now ready for 
discharge on parole. By an Act of 
Assembly, approved the 1st day of 
May, 1929, the State Board of Pardons, 
assumes supervision of all men released
on parole from the Eastern and Western 
State Penitentiaries, and the Pennsyl-
vania Industrial School at Huntingdon.
So you come directly under the super-
vision of the Board of Pardons the 
moment you are released. The officials
of this institution ahve no further jur-
isdiction over you, unless you violate 
your parole and the Supervisor of Pa-
roles, by authority of the Board of 
Pardons, orders your return to the 
penitentiary. In that event we again
assume jurisdiction over you.

The plan as established by the State 
Board of Pardons for supervision of 
the men on parole is briefly outlined as
follows: 

When released from the penitentiary
you are given a copy of the rules and
regulations to be observed while on pa-
role. You should read these over and
make every effort to co-operate in ob-
serving them. You are advised to re-
port to a specific Field Agent who has
supervision of all paroled prisoners in
the locality where you plan to reside. 
This Field Agent will visit you at least 
once a month. He is your friend, and
his purpose is to counsel, advise and
assist you, whenever and wherever pos-
sible, in your efforts to regain your 
normal place in society again. These
Field Agents are responsible to the 
Supervisor of Paroles, who in turn is 
responsible to the Board of Pardons.

You are advised that violations of 
the rules and regulations will subject
you to return to the penitentiary. By pro-
visions of the Act of Assembly of May
10, 1909, if you are convicted of a crime 
while on parole it is mandatory that 
you return to serve the full maximum 
sentence as originally imposed, without
any credit for the time you were out.
So don't commit a crime on parole and
then when you get back to the institu-
tion expect the officials to find some
loop-hole through which they can re-
parole you. Their hands are tied by
law.

Infractions of the fules and regula-
tions, such as failure to report, chang-
ing addresses without permission, being 
drunk and disorderly in conduct, etc., 
when they cause your return, permit
your being reparoled, but not until such 
time as approved by the Supervisor of
Paroles, and the Board of Pardons.

You will note the important 
points:

1. Attend to the matter of sponsorship and
employment promptly and insufficient
time so there will be no delay in your
release at the proper time.
2. Your supervision while on parole is not 
by the officials of the penitentiary
3. A violation of parole by conviction for
another crime while on parole prhibits
consideration for reparole."

Clergymen of different 
denominations make almost
daily appearances

The public services of the Pro-
testant group are held every Sun-

11 and 2 blocks, at 9:15. In this
penitentiary attendance is entirely
optional. The program as followed
has been the leadership of the Sal-
vation Army on the second and 
fourth Sundays of each month.
The alternating Sundays are as-
signed to Rev. Frederick A. Smith,
of the Lutheran City Mission and
the Rev. Vincent J. Steffan. From
8 to 9 every Sunday morning Epis-
copal services are conducted in the
Chapel by Rev. Alfred M. Smith.
In all of these services inmate 
choirs participate in the music.

One of the valued offerings of
the religious ministry of the prison
is the personal service of Rev. Al-
fred M. Smith, Rev. Frederick A.
Smith, Rev. Vincent J. Steffan and
Brigadier Frank Croft of the Sal-
vation Army. These clergymen
visit the Institution practically ev-
ery day and conduct personal in-
terviews upon a wide field of sub-
jects among the inmates. The re-
ceiving gallery and the hospital
are especially assigned. We are
favored by the regular visits of
several clergyman of the different
denominations of colored groups.
Reports of an individual character
have been submitted by these visit-
ing ministers together with an ac-
count of the special services of the 
Christian Science body under the
direction of Mr. H. A. Nelke.

Ample opportunity is given to
all inmates to attend religious ser-
vices of the Protestant, the Cath-
olic and the Jewish Groups. There
is an emphasis placed upon the val-
ue of public worship, conformity 
to the principles of the religious
preferences cited at the time of 
the individual's admission to the
prison, and the study of the Word
of God under capable teaching.
The larger influences of religion
within this prison is unquestion-
ably the personal application of
its principles to the domestic and 
case problems of the inmate pop-
ulation. The loss of liberty provokes
the tremendous urge to regain that 
liberty. There are comforts and 
reconciliations in the message of 
all religions. There is value in the 
worship of the public assembly.
There is, however, no substitute for
the lifting power of personal coun-
sel which interprets the shattered 
hopes of a segregated group and
restores the individuals of such
group to the prospect of new starts
in life for themselves and the re-
newed confidence of their neigh-
bors. We subscribe to the liberal
personal contact of selected clergy-
men in the creation of new hopes
where despair may prevail.

To take things as they be—

No use to holler, mope, or cuss—
If they was changed they might be wuss.

If rain is pouring down,

I ain't a-fearin' we'll be hit,
But grin that I ain't out in it.

If I get deep in debt,
It hasn't happened yet—
And owed a man two dollars, Gee:

And tried to do me wrong,

To thank the Lord I wasn't him.

So dark there wasn't light

To strike a match and find out where.

THE SECOND DAY he joined the 
Twelfth Bristol Fighter Squad-
ron, Tim Barbour got his repu-
tation, and it was an evil one. So
was his nickname—the natural af-
termath of his reputation. Even 
the grease-balls took it upon them-
selves to be uppity with him. Ev-
erybody in the Twelfth called him 
""Chicken-Heart.""

When a man is called Chicken-
Heart, it can mean but one thing
—that he is a coward. And that
indeed was the Twelfth's opinion
of Barbour. They called him
Chicken-Heart to his face—and he
swallowed it and made no protest.

Wing companies excuse a great
deal in a man. He may be a boast-
er, a drunkard, a fool, wastrel; but
if he can fight, all these faults are
too easily forgiven and forgotten.
Not so with the cardinal sin of 
cowardice. That is the one fault 
which flyers—men who daily, hour-
ly, risk life and limb in the clouds
—will not abide.

Barbour learned, to his misery,
that the reputation of being a cow-
ard was all too easily gained and 
almost impossible to erase. He 
gained it one night in the local
estaminet where members of the
Twelfth were wont to foregather of
an evening to swap songs. Here
stories of the day's exploits were 
recounted, and the men limbered
up their fight-jaded sense with
white and red Frog lubricant.

Barbour had just come up from
Issoudon with a load of green
wingmen in the replacements. He
was tipping a glass to his lips when
someone jostled his elbow. The
glass flew from his fingers, its con-
tents be-spattering the face, collar
and tunic of one Mike McGovern,
a half-wing and observer. Now
Mike was Irish and Tim Barbour
was red-haired, lithe and rangy.
The members of the Twelfth looked
forward with eager interest to a 
good scrap. They knew Mike. He
loved nothing better than an even-
ing's stand-up-and-knock-down-
brawl. They expected Barbour's 
red hair was an indication of fistic
propensities. But in that they were 
woefully disappointed. No sooner
had Mike arisen, with the wild bel-
lowings of a maddened bull, than
Tim Barbour also rose to his feet
—white, trembling, unnerved.

No one spoke at sight of the agi-
tated young man. In fact many 
of the Twelfth's wingmen looked
away as would men whose stom-
achs proved too squeamish. They
couldn't bear to see a two-fisted
kid backing down. And that is
just what he did. Tim Barbour
backed down. He listened, with a
nervous, deprecating grin, to Mike's
abusive flow of language. Mike
called him everything from a skunk
to things unprintable. He took it
with a strained smile, his hands
gripping the edge of the table so
tightly that the knuckles showed a
line of white. His face wore a
tight unhappy look. That look—
members of the Twelfth interpret-
ed as meaning only one thing—
Tim Barbour was afraid.

""I'm—I'm very sorry,"" he said
in a low, hesitant voice when Mike
paused to take a breath. ""It won't
-er-happen again, I assure you.
Please forget it.""

""Shore, an' why should Oi for-
get, yuh lanky bean-pole?"" roared
the obstreperous Mike. ""Why, yuh
look so damn scairt, Oi wonder can
yuh raise yore fists to fight, by
golly.""

""Please,"" muttered Barbour.
""I apologized. That ought to be
enough. I don't care to fight.""

""Don't care,"" bellowed Mike,
unabashed, ""it's afraid yuh are, 
that's what it is. Why for two 
cents—"" He broke off in complete 
disgust. ""What's the use? You're 
yellow.""

Not even at that insulting re-
mark did Barbour take offense. He
grinned a sickly grin, then sub-
sided into his seat, face flaming
with embarrassment. Mike McGov-
ern turned away. And so did every
other member of the Twelfth. In
five minutes Tim Barbour found
he was sitting alone at his table.
In ten minutes he was in sole pos-
session of the entire corner. The
next morning his reputation was
consolidated. He was ""Chicken-
Heart"" Barbour to everybody.

He was an outcast—branded a coward.

* * * 

So passed a month. 
Barbour still hung on. It was
thought that he would seek to
be transferred where at least his
reputation was unkown, but he 
made no such move. The night of
June 18th, he was sitting in his
tiny room. From the estaminet 
came strains of happy music—
piano and voice. Suddenly, like a
bolt out of the dark sky overhead,
came a series of bombs. One struck
the landing field, plowing up the 
turf. Another missed the Admin-
istration building by a couple of 
yards. The third bit the estaminet.
Out of the chaos and the thunder, 
out of the screams of the wounded
and dying, came a steady voiced
summons.

""A Boche bombing party. To 
the air, men. Toddle out the 
crates."" The Twelfth never knew
that the voice so bold, so steady,
so challenging was that of Chicken-
Heart Barbour. In ten minutes
three planes had been rolled out
of the hangars. Their motors were
kicked over and they tore cross-
wind down the field, zooming for 
the stars. In one of the three
planes, Mike McGovern was busy
buckling himself into the observer's
seat. In the rush and hurry of the
take-off, he had not seen his part-
ner. He thumped the camel back
that separated pilot and observer
and the pilot turned about. Both 
men looked surprised, but Mike's
face also registered disgust. The
pilot was Chicken-Heart Barbour.
""I would draw the lemon,"" growled
Mike.

Anti-aircraft batteries were
shooting for all they were worth.
Three streaks of brilliant white 
light speared the heavens, marking 
the positions of the Fokker D7s.
Before the first of the three Bris-
tols got her proper fighting alti-
tude, two of the Fokkers swooped
down upon her and blasted her out
of the sky. It looked like a rout.
Mike swore under his breath, gave
his Vickers a warming burst. He
shouted as he recognized one of 
the Boche planes as that of von
Stollen, the famed German ace.
But he was busy the next second
keeping another of the Fokkers off
his tail. Out of the corner of his 
eye, he saw von Stollen rush at the 
Bristol. He groaned, but Barbour 
instantly shot the ship into a zoom. 
Up and down across and back, the
planes wheeled, looped, zoomed,
dived. The Germans were fast
getting the upper hand.

Barbour was flying like a gen-
ius or a maniac; it was hard to tell
which. Like a comet, the German
ace ripped across the Bristol's path 
and fired a blazing stream into her 
nose. Mike himself was shooting
wildly. He yelled lustily as one of
the Fokkers tumbled earthward, a
pillar of descending flame. Pour-
ing full gun to the roaring Rolls
motor, Barbour tore at von Stollen.
But suddenly the German ace's 
Spandau stream stopped. Just as
suddenly a searchlight caught the 
Fokker and Barbour and Mike saw
von Stollen's hands—both of them
—raised above his head.

It was a moment for a perfect
burst from Barbour's guns, but he
did not fire. Those raised hands
of the Boche reitmeister meant one
thing: his gun had jammed. One
blast and the German ace would be 
no more. But Barbour, instead of 
firing, threw the Bristol around in
a steep bank, saw that the other 
Bristol was more than holding its
own against the second Fokker.
Then he saw flickering tongues of
orange and green flame spurt from
von Stollen's Spandrau. The gun
was working again. The German 
waved a hand, and Barbour also
waved. Grinning Mike McGovern
waved back also.

And then the fierce battle was re-
sumed in earnest. Roaring Vickers
were matched against spattering 
Spandau; Yankee grit against Ger-
man nerve. Fire and flame against
flame and fire. Bullets crackled
against bullets, mile high in the
sky. Molten steel hit at Barbour's 
gun hand. But before the hand
was disabled he launched a scald-
ing stream of tracers into the Fok-
ker's belly. Blood poured from his
hand, but he paid no attention.
One of his bullets had hit the mark.
Von Stollen's Fokker exploded in
mid-air, lighting up the sky. Cov-
ered with blood and smeared with
grit and oil, Barbour clambered
from the cock-pit. Mike McGovern
threw an arm around him.

Kick me damned hard. Oi've been
a fool, calling yuh Chicken-Heart.
'Tis 'Great-Heart' yuh should be
named. As soon as Oi seen yuh give 
that Jerry ace a chancet when his
gun jammed, Oi knew yuh was no
coward. It took nerve to let him
get an even chancet against yuh.
There ain't anuther pilot in the 
company would'a done it.""

Mike's voice dropped. ""But, son,
why didn't yuh put up your fists
to me that first night? Hell, I bet
yuh could lick me.""

Barbour grinned happily. ""Lick
you? Sure, with one hand behind
my back. Listen, I didn't feel
called upon to explain before, but 
now I will. Years ago, I took an 
oath never to fight. Sounds funny,
huh? Well, here's why.

""I got red hair and a terrible 
temper. Once I nearly killed a
guy in a fight. You see, I just for-
get everything, my mind goes
blank. I'm—I'm like crazy. So I 
made myself promise never again
to fight. It's the only way. It's
the code I wrote for myself.""

""Yeah,"" echoed Mike, slapping
Barbour on the shoulder. ""Call it
the sky-devil's code.""

63,The Question Box,Unknown,Pen Points,,1934,2,14,1,1,,1934.02.14.04_PenPoints.jpg,,item,"The Question Box

1. Question:—If granted com-
mutation of sentence by the State
Board of Pardons at the February
meeting, how soon thereafter will
I be released?

Answer:—First it is neces-
sary that the official papers,
signed by the Governor cer-
tifying to the commutation
of your sentence, be received
at this Institution. After re-
ceipt of the official papers,
you are given a hearing be-
fore the institution Parole
Board, and generally recom-
mended for parole. This rec-
ommendation for parole must
then be forwarded to the 
State Board of Pardons at
its next meeting. The Board
of Pardons then considers
the recommendation for
your parole and if approved,
the papers are forwarded to
the Governor for his signa-
ture. After which they are 
sent to the Institution. Up-
on receipt of the Parole pa-
pers, you are then released.
It generally takes from 4 to 
6 weeks from the date of the
granting of commutation.

* * * *

2. Question:—If I am granted 
commutation of sentence by the
State Board of Pardons, do the pa-
role regulations govern me in the
same manner as an inmate released
on parole at the expiration of his
minimum sentence?

Answer:—Yes. Commutat-
tion of sentence by the State
Board of Pardons is reduc-
ing the time of your mini-
mum sentence to expire on a
date fixed by the Pardon 
Board. Your parole is then
secured in the same manner
as if your minimum sentence 
had expired, and you are
subjected to all the rules and
regulations of the State Pa-
role Board in the same man-
ner as an inmate released at 
the expiration of his sent-
ence. For example, if you
were serving a 10 to 20 year
sentence and made applica-
tion to the State Board of 
Pardons after having served
4 years and were successful
in receiving favorable action
by the Board of Pardons, 
your sentence would then 
read from 4 to 20 years and
would be subject to the pa-
role regulations for a period 
of 16 years.

* * * *

3. Question:—If I desire infor-
mation on questions not clear in 
my mind about my sentence, par-
don, or parole matters, how could
I secure this information?

Answers—At 2:30 P.M. each
Wednesday, interviews are 
held by the Institution and
State Parole Officers who at
this time will attempt to an-
swer any questions that are
placed before them. These in-
terviews are held in the De-
puty's Office or any other of-
fice nearby.

* * * *

4. Question:—When making ap-
plication to the State Pardon 
Board, is it necessary to employ
an Attorney?

Answer:—No. The Officials
of the INstitution are very glad
to give assistance in this mat-
ter. Consult your Chaplain
who will advise you how to
have your papers made out
without the employment of an 
Attorney."

Bible Study Class

One of the activities not so com-
monly known is the Bible Study
class which is conducted every
Wednesday afternoon at 2 P.M. in
the Synagogue by Rev. Frederick 
Smith, the Lutheran Chaplain.

In this class there is exhaustive
study made, with the Bible as the 
only text book. The men are fur-
nished with study help sheets one
week in advance of each class in
order that they might have a bibli-
cal background before coming in
for the lecture. A round table dis-
cussion follows each study and
many of the men are unquestion-
ably receiving considerable benefit
from the study.

The popularity of this class
among those who are acquainted
with it may be attested by the fact
that the group at the Farm came
out 100 percent on a day when one
of the World Series games was be-
ing broadcast and shown upon an 
electric scoreboard.

Any man in the institution is
welcome and will find the Rev. Mr. 
Smith to be more than willing to
confer with him on any problems
that might arise, and that are with-
in the scope of a Chaplain's work.
On Wednesday, February 14, the
class will begin their studies of the
Confessions of the Church."

Education has no beginning and
no end. Children begin to read be-
fore they begin to talk. Aged men
and women continue to learn until
the time of physical dissolution.
The world is a school, humanity is
a succession of classes at study.
Every crisis, every moral test, ev-
ery demand for judgment, is an
examination. In the end, the great-
est degree of all is in the thought
that one may face the hereafter 
without fear.

Colleges have no magic. They
cannot transmute base metal into
gold. They organize and coordin-
ate the world's offerings in learn-
ing and in wisdom. Those offerings
are everywhere. To the man or
woman unable to go to college, they
are yet at hand and available. Read
—Read good books!

All the thoughts of the ancient 
philosophers are set down in print
for all generations. Aristotle, Plato
and the rest are gone, yet they re-
main forever. The great struggles
of humanity to rise; the uncon-
querable determination of the race
to achieve freedom and happiness;
these are on the records. Readers 
of books can live again the emo-
tions that have swayed people and
determined the boundaries of na-
tions. The high thoguhts of Emer-
son and the gentle humor of Dr. 
Holmes, these remain with us—
friendly companions that will come
at a gesture. The singing narra-
tives of Homer go singing through 
the ages.

Read—there is no book which
youths will read in preparation for
the mid-year of final examinations,
which those who are not in institu-
tions of learning may not have for 
themselves. There is no wealth of
learning which one may not ap-
proach through the printed page.

We hear praise for the man who
does things. Achievement, consum-
mation of purpose, these are entitled
to the admiration they receive. Yet
there never has been any deed done
in this mortal world which did not
have its preceding thought; and
the printed word is the vehicle for
most of the world's thought.

Through many centuries fine-
minded men have been striving to
advance human understanding and
wisdom. All that they have done
through the centuries is at your 
door.

Open the door and let in the 
books of the world.
