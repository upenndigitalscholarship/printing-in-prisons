# Little Mother of the Forgotten - How Jane Gates Redefined Prison Outreach

Mrs. Jane Gates, a philanthropist and dedicated member of the King’s Daughters, redefined prison outreach at Eastern State Penitentiary with her remarkable compassion and empathy. Known as the “Little Mother” by inmates, Gates offered hope, humanity, and a sense of community to people some would consider unredeemable. As mentioned in The Umpire, she “has been the means of causing many men with whom she has advised, with her bright cheeriness, to hope,”(1) a testament to the uplifting presence she brought to those behind bars.

Gates entered Eastern State as a member of the King’s Daughters, a Christian philanthropic group focused on aiding marginalized groups. During her time volunteering, she quickly became known for her work with the prison’s Honor and Friendship Club or “HFC”, a society organized by inmates aimed at personal betterment and mutual support. Her nurturing presence within the group was so impactful that she was referred to as “The Little Mother to the H.F.C” in their book of minutes (1).

With her encouragement, the HFC became a symbol of solidarity and reformation, even extending support beyond their walls. During World War I, when the value of community-building within prisons became more widely acknowledged, the HFC donated to the Mutual Death Benefit Association to aid families of deceased overseers(3). Gates championed these efforts, reinforcing the values of empathy and service among inmates. 

#### “The extent and value of this lady’s work among the inmates cannot be measured by earthly standards,” 

one report noted, reflecting the deep impact of her contributions.

## The Power of Music

Music was central to Gates’ bond with the prisoners. On one occasion, she performed a communion hymn in the chapel, moving both herself and her audience to tears. Her music, whether it was hymns or the French national anthem "Marseillaise," created moments of emotional release and dignity. “To vivify the darkened soul, and point it to a better goal,”(2) one inmate wrote in an appreciation, capturing the transformative impact of these performances. Gates recognized the power of music to lift spirits and bridge emotional divides within the penitentiary walls.

Reflecting on the gifts and expressions of gratitude shared with her by the inmates, Gates humbly wrote, 

#### “I could not keep back the tears, I was so impressed. Our lives are all crucified between smiles and tears. (2)” 

Her empathy and willingness to acknowledge the inmates' struggles forged a deep connection that resonated far beyond her weekly visits.

## Eastern State's Best Kept Secret

Despite Gates’ profound impact on the lives of the inmates, her story was only shared through articles, poems, and anecdotes featured in The Umpire. Outside the prison gates, her selfless actions went unnoticed.  Because of this, her presence within the prison was only cherished by inmates and those who were interested in learning about journalism at Eastern State. 


Gates’ story is more than just a portion in the history of Eastern State Penitentiary; it’s a guide for rethinking and improving modern prison reform. Her life’s work demonstrates that meaningful change begins with recognizing the humanity in every person. Gates challenges us to rethink the role of empathy and community support as tools for rehabilitation. Her legacy reminds us that true progress comes from seeing humanity beyond someone's current circumstance.
