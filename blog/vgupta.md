Once released in early 1894, he was quickly back in trouble with the law, this time for aa much more serious offense. On June 7th, 1894, Weber purchased a gun, and just four days later, on June 11th, he used that gun to kill his father-in-law.

## The Path to Rehabilitation: 
While Weber was on death row, his sentence was commuted to life in prison giving him another chance to live and change life’s direction. This second chance to live seems to have sparked the beginnings of Weber’s transformation. Despite the grim circumstances, Weber didn’t allow his past to define his future. Weber instead began a journey of personal grown and rehabilitating, making the most of his time behind bars and trying to improve himself. 

During his life in prison Weber worked developing himself. He was an active participant in many prison programs that were designed to give incarcerated individuals supports in their efforts to rehabilitate themselves. Through his work with these programs including the honor club, Weber was able to earn the respect of his fellow incarcerated individuals in addition to the prison staff.

## Becoming a Leader and Helping His Fellow Inmates:
Weber’s determination to improving himself wasn’t not unnoticed by others. He was given roles of responsibility and leadership in the prison, specifically as part of the honor club. He started in the club as a delegate and through his commitment to the club eventually becoming the vice president. In his role as vice president, Weber was involved in the organization of several charitable initiatives including using funds raised by the honor club to contribute to the Christmas Fund which purchase toys and other gifts for the children of those incarnated at the prison.

## The Honor Club's Support:
Weber’s dedication to the honor club and transformation to someone with a passion for helping those around earned him the support and respect of his fellow honor club members. Believing in Weber and his rehabilitation, the honor club voted to use their funds to help Weber complete his application for parole. Weber wanted to be paroled so he could be with his 87-year-old mother during the last few years of her life.

## The Long Road to Freedom:
Despite the letter of support written by the honor club, Weber’s journey towards freedom was not straightforward or without strife. Weber applied for parole six time before finally being granted release. Each denial must have been difficult, being told you are not fit to be part of society, but Weber remained steadfast on achieving his goal relying on the support and strength given to him by the encouragement by his honor club peers.
