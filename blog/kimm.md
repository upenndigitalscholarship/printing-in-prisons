David O. Hume's criminal record and personal background paint a picture of a man navigating a challenging life in early 20th-century Pennsylvania. Born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1887, Hume grew up in modest surroundings, reaching only the 8th grade in primary education. By age 16, he had left home, presumably to work and support himself, a common circumstance for young men of his time. Until he was arrested, Hume worked as an electrician.

Hume’s physical description aligns with a traditional archetype of the working man. Standing at nearly six feet tall, with blue eyes and brown hair, he bore visible tattoos on his forearms: images of hearts, people, and words like “LOVE.” These tattoos might hint at a personal life colored by affection and loyalty, possibly with family members or close relationships. His tattoos, marking him as someone with stories and connections, add a layer of humanity to his otherwise austere criminal record.

Hume’s criminal history centers on charges of larceny, primarily involving theft from freight cars. His conviction for a larceny offense in Cumberland County led to a four year sentence at Eastern State Penitentiary (inmate B5163) imposed in November 1909. However, this was not his first brush with the law. Hume had previously served time in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, where he was sentenced to a year and five months for a similar larceny-related offense. In Dauphin County, he also served six months in jail, suggesting a pattern of property crimes that might reflect economic hardship or a lack of stable employment. The record hints at his associations being "ordinary people"—likely others within his working-class community—showing that his social environment may have influenced his actions.

Despite his convictions, Hume’s record doesn’t suggest any history of violence or serious personal instability. He smoked and chewed tobacco, drank occasionally, and, while his record marks him as “Protestant,” it also notes his use of profanity. These details add texture to his character, suggesting a man roughened by life’s difficulties but grounded in his religious and cultural identity. Interestingly, while there is a section to indicate whether alcohol contributed to his criminal behavior, this is left blank, leaving room to wonder whether his larceny crimes were indeed purely economic.

Hume's criminal record gives us a glimpse into the complexities of Hume’s life. Through a digital humanities lens, Hume’s record serves as a historical artifact, a window into the struggles, choices, and identity of a man etched into the judicial system of early 20th-century Pennsylvania.

David O. Hume’s time at Eastern State Penitentiary was marked by a profound involvement in the institution’s band, where he served as both a cornet player and occasional conductor. The penitentiary’s band, known as the E.S.P. Band, held concerts for special occasions, such as Thanksgiving and New Year’s, offering a unique cultural experience within the prison walls. These events provided an artistic outlet not only for Hume but for the incarcerated population as a whole, creating a sense of community and normalcy amid confinement. Through his participation, Hume became part of a structured and purposeful activity, performing pieces from well-known composers like Godfrey and Suppe. His skill as a cornet player was evident in selections that demanded precision and talent, including challenging solos like the duet “Friendly Rivals” by Godfrey, which he performed under the direction of Prof. Wiegandt. It remains unknown whether Hume began playing the cornet before or only after arriving at Eastern State, but his dedication to the instrument became well-documented during his time there.

Despite the fact that most of the band members were novices, the E.S.P. Band’s performances were well-received by the audience, which often included prison staff, officials, and sometimes special guests. The band’s ability to deliver sophisticated renditions of patriotic marches, classical pieces, and operatic selections surprised and impressed listeners. The Thanksgiving concert, for example, featured complex and stirring compositions such as Sousa’s “The Thunderer” and a selection from “The Mikado,” both of which required precision and coordination from the musicians. The positive reception to these concerts reflected a recognition of the inmates' commitment and talents.

Hume's role in the band extended beyond performance, as he occasionally took on the role of conductor. This leadership responsibility highlighted his dedication to music and his capability to guide his fellow inmates in rehearsals and performances. Conducting required him to unify the band members, coordinate timing, and bring out the emotional depth of each piece, an impressive feat in the environment of a penitentiary. His involvement in these music programs likely fostered a sense of purpose and respect among his peers. In an environment focused on restriction and punishment, music served as a bridge to expression, allowing Hume and his fellow inmates to engage in an experience that elevated them beyond their sentences, if only temporarily.

Hume’s participation in these musical events not only showcased his personal talents but also underscored the value of art and music as rehabilitative tools within Eastern State Penitentiary. His experiences as both a musician and conductor contributed to a richer, more complex narrative of his time in prison—one that reveals the humanizing power of music within even the most restrictive of environments.

While Eastern State Penitentiary initially focused on solitary confinement, by the early twentieth century, athletic programs were introduced for inmates. The administration believed that baseball could play a vital role in the rehabilitation process. Consequently, the prison established its own baseball league, at a time when baseball was becoming increasingly recognized as America’s “national pastime.” For the inmates, baseball provided them with a sense of community and autonomy within the confines of prison. 

Hume exemplified this engagement with the Eastern State Penitentiary community through his participation in the E.S.P. Baseball League, where he played for Team “Band” and served as the team manager. His position as the team manager most likely conveys the respect he had within the band, as well as his sense of responsibility. Although he may not have been a standout baseball player, being a player and manager within the league most likely allowed Hume to foster camaraderie with his fellow inmates and carve out his identity within a competitive environment.

In addition to his athletic pursuits, Hume produced and sold portraits done in watercolors, sketches, and holiday cards, demonstrating a creative side that further distinguished him among the inmate population. His offerings included holiday-specific pieces, like Christmas and New Year’s cards, as well as framed sketches and colored etchings. The ability to sell his work most likely enabled Hume to establish a unique position among the inmates.

Through both his sportsmanship on Team “Band” and his artistic talents, Hume fostered a sense of individuality and respect that might otherwise have been difficult to achieve within the constraints of prison life. Hume’s engagement in these pursuits exemplifies how artistic expression and communal activities can serve as a form of self-affirmation and identity-building, even in an environment focused on punishment and isolation.

David Hume was released from Eastern State Penitentiary after serving his four year sentence.

Hume became an active member of Westminster Presbyterian Church after his release. His dedication to the church and community was evident through his musical contributions, as he performed as a cornet player in church-sponsored events. One such occasion was a musical event hosted by the Christian Endeavor Society, where Hume’s cornet solo was a featured performance. 

In addition to performing at events, Hume’s active involvement extended to participating in gatherings and social events hosted by the church community. He was a member of the H.C. Miller Bible Class, a group within the Westminster Sunday School, and regularly attended meetings and social gatherings. These engagements highlight Hume’s integration into the church’s social fabric and his commitment to building relationships with other members. His life post-incarceration at Eastern State reflects a deep dedication to faith, fellowship, and community involvement, especially through his musical talents and participation in the church’s social life.
