## Barbershop Talks Behind Bars: The Forgotten Community Spaces of Eastern State Penitentiary  

When thinking about life in prisons, community is not typically the first thing that  
comes to mind, especially at Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  
This infamous prison, known for its harsh environment, was established in the 19th century  
with dehumanizing features such as confinement, isolation, and strict codes of silence.  

Despite these oppressive aspects, certain spaces within the prison, like the barbershop,  
fostered a sense of community both within the prison walls and beyond.  

Growing up, I spent much time in a barbershop, a place where my friends and I  
would hang out even if we weren’t there for haircuts. We would talk about  
everything from debates on LeBron vs. Jordan, discussions about building generational wealth,  
to even casual conversations about upcoming school assignments. The barbershop was a  
place where I, as a Black man, felt free to express my feelings and emotions.  

After school, if my friends and I wanted to avoid chores at home, we’d stop  
by the barbershop to check in with our barber-mentor, play video games, and relax.  
I never took this space for granted because there aren’t many places offering  
the same freedom that barbershops provide Black men across America.  

### Breaking the Code: Creating Communal Spaces

Similarly, barbershops at Eastern State Penitentiary played a major role in counteracting  
the dehumanizing isolation that defined the prison. Historical records indicate that each  
cell block had at least one vacant cell set aside as a barbershop, quickly  
becoming a communal hub. In a prison where inmates were confined to solitary spaces  
and punished for attempting to communicate, these barbershops offered an essential outlet  
for human interaction. While sports like baseball fostered a sense of community outdoors,  
inside the cell blocks, barbershops were one of the few spaces where inmates could  
simply be human.  

Even the prison guards participated in this communal space, sometimes receiving haircuts  
from inmate barbers and even bringing in family members as clients. This interaction  
suggests a level of trust from guards, who, despite often having antagonistic relationships  
with inmates, saw the barbershops as a place to connect. A guard would not recommend  
a barber to friends and family if they didn’t trust the quality of the haircut.  
This dynamic reflects the community-building power of the barbershop, bringing people  
together in an environment otherwise defined by hostility.  

### Contributing to Prison Community and Beyond  

In a setting where prisoners were often stripped of their freedom to talk openly,  
these barbershops were incredibly valuable. Men have historically faced societal challenges  
in expressing their emotions, and prisoners had even fewer outlets. The opportunity  
to socialize in a barbershop likely boosted many inmates’ mental health as they escaped,  
even briefly, the isolation that defined prison life. But the freedom provided by  
these barbershops extended beyond socializing. Barbershops also fostered economic growth  
within the prison and helped prepare inmates for potential careers on the outside.

Operating a barbershop business within the prison equipped inmates with specific skills  
and experience that could support a career as a barber post-release. According to  
the *Eastern Echo Newspaper*, the State Barber Board required inmate barbers to pass  
a written exam and demonstrate specialized barbering skills to earn their title. This  
practical training and qualification process gave inmates a sense of purpose and perhaps  
encouraged them to build a better life upon release. Black barbershops have long been  
central to cultural expression and economic growth in communities across the United States,  
and the skills honed within prison barbershops connect directly to this historical legacy.  

The prison barbershop was more than a place to get a haircut; it was a space  
for fostering relationships, improving mental health, and promoting economic growth both  
inside and outside of Eastern State Penitentiary. The barbershops within Eastern State  
mirrored the historical significance that barbershops have held in communities nationwide,  
particularly within African American communities. For the inmates of Eastern State,  
these spaces were a reminder of freedom, connection, and the possibilities that lay ahead.
