# Context
B-6594 was an incarcerated person at the Eastern State who wrote weekly for The Umpire. They wrote 25 pieces spanning from July 23rd, 1913 to December 31st, 1913; thereafter, their pieces do not appear again. 

B-6594 writes in a journalistic tone, in which their pieces jot down their thoughts on different human characteristics — from kindness to evil — and their many nuances and complexities, especially from the perspective of a seemingly devout Christian. Throughout this essay, we will be taking a look at their “Moral Essays” in particular, in which each piece dives into a moral value. It will be especially interesting to think of these pieces in the context of WWI — which begins the following year.

*Please note: given B-6594's pronouns are unclear, I will be referencing to B-6594 as “they, them, theirs” instead of assuming “he/him/his.”*

# Further Important Notes to Consider
It is important to keep in mind that B-6594 wrote for a publication approved by an institution. Their voice was only heard because of approval from a higher power at play. Therefore, much of what they wrote might not be hollistically their belief, but a filtered version of what they are allowed to say. At times, instead of truly writing what they believe, what was written could have been a means to please the institution in charge as a means to incur favors or perhaps be released early — given the positivity, compassion and deep self-reflection radiating from the following texts. 

To give the individual the benefit of the doubt, these essays could also be a reflection of a turning point in B-6594's life: a sort of awakening to approach life relying on their moral compass and potentially newfound resonance with Christian belief. It was from this angle in which the “Moral Essays” series was analyzed.
