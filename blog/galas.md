## My (Great-)Uncle Walter

Walter Gala was a Philadelphia native who became a practiced nurse during his incarceration at 
Eastern State Penitentiary between 1949 and 1967 for the first-degree murder of his wife, 22-year 
old Ruth Gala. He appears in the public record through census records listing basic information, 
news coverage over the murder that led to his incarceration and his eventual commutation, and features in Eastern State’s prison newspaper, the Eastern Echo. Details from how he appears in the written record, considered within the context of the institutions and relationships that shaped him, offer greater clarity on the significance of incarceration within his life’s trajectory. Overall, the constraints of imprisonment in combination with Walter’s choices while incarcerated led to years in the otherwise inaccessible field of nursing, shifts in family relationships marked by absence and an interruption of patterns of violence, and the formation of a positive reputation which influenced his ultimate commutation. Further, the written sources he appears in possess lenses and biases that further illuminate major themes in his life: limited consideration of his history of interpersonal harm, strained familial connection, and belief in the potential of prisoners for rehabilitation. He is also my great-uncle, and consideration of my connection to a historic institution dedicated to incarceration through his imprisonment has led to greater reflection on the presence of the carceral system in present-day Philadelphia, as well as the value of work to weaken its reach.
