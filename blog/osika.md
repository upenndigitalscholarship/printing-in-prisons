    <p><strong>William Marvel’s life defies the stereotypical image of a prisoner.</strong> Born in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1863, Marvel was well-educated, having completed ten years of public schooling and six years of private education (1). Despite this background, he found himself repeatedly in conflict with the law, first convicted of larceny in 1893 and ultimately imprisoned five times over a span of 24 years, several of which were at Eastern State Penitentiary (1). Through his experiences, Marvel emerged not only as an inmate but also as a voice for reform, contributing to prison publications and advocating for a parole system focused on dignity, responsibility, and rehabilitation – a perspective which was shaped by his own complicated journey within the legal system.</p>

    <h2><strong>Contributions to <em>The Umpire</em> and a Vision for Parole Reform</strong></h2>
    <p>During his time at Eastern State, Marvel (prisoner B7542) was an active member of the community. No information on Marvel is present in <em>The Umpire</em>, the prison’s publication, during his earliest imprisonments; however, during his final sentence at Eastern State, Marvel wrote extensively for <em>The Umpire</em>. His contributions include articles addressing prison policies, including one in March 1916 discussing a new parole method: those imprisoned would be allowed work outside the prison during the day, but return at night, and wages could support dependents or be for personal use (2). This progressive method prioritizes gradual reintegration into society, forming a bridge between incarcerated life and the outside world. Marvel suggests that employment in this manner restores dignity, considering the emotional toll incarceration takes on identity and self-worth. He further suggests that parole under such circumstances doesn’t just release a prisoner, but holds them accountable in a way that encourages self-discipline – a trait he believes can be cultivated – since the person on parole “is a free man, his conduct insuring his privilege” (2). Marvel’s advocacy for a parole system that includes supervised freedom, steady employment, and a sense of responsibility illustrates his belief in a justice system focused on reform rather than mere punishment.</p>

      <figcaption>This page of <em>The Umpire</em>, from volume 5, issue 13 published on March 29th, 1916, contains the article "A Novel Parole Method" written by William Marvel (B7542).

    <p>Marvel also served as the secretary of the prison’s Honor and Friendship Club (H.F.C.) from November 1st, 1916 to August 1st, 1917, and was responsible for the communication of community announcements and updates from the H.F.C. (3, 4). His involvement extended to making donations to the prison’s holiday fund, showing an ongoing interest in supporting philanthropic causes as well (5). These roles hint at Marvel’s desire to make a positive impact, challenging the perception of him as solely a repeat offender.</p>

    <h2><strong>Legal Struggles and Repeated Imprisonments</strong></h2>
    <p>Articles from <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em> provide further detail on Marvel’s earlier imprisonments. His first criminal act occurred in 1893; Marvel was brought to court “on the charges of conspiracy and larceny of two suits of clothes, worth $50, from Jacob Reed’s Sons” (6). Late <em>Inquirer</em> articles indicate he served a 9 month sentence at Blackwell’s Island prison in New York (6). In October 1897, Marvel was arrested in New York “for stealing a diamond stud,” and sentenced to two years and nine months (eight months of which was later removed “for good behavior”) at a county prison.</p>
    <p>Despite his early release, he was reported to have “been arrested several times and…out of jail only a few months” when he stole “a pair of trousers valued at $6 from a Market street department store” in Philadelphia (6). Unfortunately, Marvel was subject to a new law that stated, “in the case of old offenders the maximum penalty is to be doubled,” and he was sentenced to six years in Eastern State (6). Marvel does not appear to have contributed to <em>The Umpire</em> during this time.</p>
    <p>Finally, Marvel was under scrutiny following the death of his wife, Edith Marvel, in February 1912, though police believed he was not involved in her fatal shooting (6). Although Marvel was expected to be exonerated in relation to his wife’s death, he faced arrest on separate charges, including accusations of selling cocaine and morphine. Authorities had uncovered evidence suggesting Marvel posed as a doctor, finding business cards labeled "Dr. William F. Marvel" and medical instruments, which may have contributed to his alias but may also have instead been connected to his wife's work as a nurse. According to an article in <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, despite these charges, a judge “declared that the defendant had decided to reform and in consequence of the attorney’s plea…discharged Marvel” (6). </p>
    <p>Marvel was then convicted of larceny three years later in February of 1915, as well as possession of cocaine, receiving a sentence of 2 years and 10 months with a maximum of 3 years and a $10 fine (1, 4). It was this term of imprisonment that saw Marvel’s aforementioned contributions to <em>The Umpire</em> and Easten State life as a whole.</p>

    <h2><strong>Confronting the 'After Prison' Problem</strong></h2>
    <p>It is interesting to reflect upon Marvel’s multiple imprisonments, especially in the context of his contributions to <em>The Umpire</em> and published perspective on prison parole. At the end of his article, “A Novel Parole Method,” Marvel writes, “There is much to be said of this method from the inmate’s point of view, where the intent to meet the ‘after prison – what?’ problem is hazy and hopeless” (1). Here, Marvel captures the anxieties around reintegration after incarceration, pointing out that without a supportive structure, former inmates may find themselves lost, facing significant societal barriers. Considering his repeated incarcerations, perhaps Marvel’s words reflect an underlying sense of personal moroseness, as he, too, understands the struggle of finding purpose and stability after prison.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, the term of imprisonment during which Marvel wrote this article appears to have been his last in Eastern State. Perhaps Marvel was able to adopt the “right living” habits, which he argued could become as ingrained as former destructive behaviors through a parole method (1). His insights reflect a psychological understanding, unusual for his time, which recognizes that rehabilitation required transforming mindsets, not just punishing actions, and perhaps after the publication of this articulate reflection his own mindset was transformed as well. Ultimately, Marvel’s story reminds us that behind the bars are individuals whose lives and contributions are as multifaceted as anyone’s.</p>
