## <center> Baseball at Eastern State Penitentiary in 1913 </center>

During the period of 1910 - 1913,  the American and National basebal league had become popular and began to attract an average of 6 million people per year.<sup>[3](#hayburn)</sup> Baseball had become an American pastime resulting in major league teams building and renovating 10 stadiums between 1909 and 1914 to entertain larger crowds at games.<sup>[3](#hayburn)</sup> Soon baseball became apart of prison life as prison officials began healthy recreationa activities such as baseball could provide rehabilitation by instilling middle-classed american values in prisoners and remove criminal tendencies.<sup>[3](#hayburn)</sup> This view was further supported by new ideas of treating criminals in a humane manner.<sup>[3](#hayburn)</sup> Baseball at ESP became a way for prisoners to have autonomy, be empowered and have a sense of agency. Inmates also learned to control their emotions as to be involved in these games, they had to abide by rules on the field such as not doing anything detrimental to the game i.e fighting which would result in them being suspended from the games. 

To expand the rehabilitation process of the inmates through baseball a newsletter called The Umpire was created at Eastern State Penitentiary to compliment their inmate baseball league. The Umpire provides a detailed look at the culture of Eastern State Penitentiary and how it was interwoven into the daily life of prisoners givening them a sense of control. The Umpire is filled with poems, images and articles and game statistics of the ESP League. This is so as the newspaper was a way for those who could not partake in the games to keep up with not only the game but with events that took place on the field. Thus, the umpire showcased a few comics. There were 6 teams in the ESP baseball league: Ninth Block, the Library, the Plasterers, Stocking Shed, Band Team and Cubs. These teams had White and Black prisoners on the same team which contrasted with the segregation found on cell blocks until 1961 and in professional baseball until 1947.<sup>[1](#esp_break)</sup> In the year 1913, Ninth Block won the ESP League. 

Below is a photo of prisoners playing baseball on the field at ESP between Cellblocks 3 and 4.<sup>[2](#esp)</sup>

## <center> Ducky aka Duckie </center>

Ducky was one of the most frequently mentioned inmates. The articles suggest that Ducky was on the Shed Team of the ESP League. Given Ducky has historically been a nickname given to individuals with names such as McDonald or Donald. Stewart McDonald is the only inmate on the shed team in 1913 who had a name that merits a nickname such as Ducky. Thus, we inferred that Ducky is inmate 5101. Steward MacDonald was from Bucks County and 29 years old at the time of his arrest for a felony with a minimum sentence of 2 yrs 6 months and a max sentence of 10yrs. He was convicted 6 times and paid 1 fine. He was received at the prison on September 30th, 1909 and expected to be released on March 23rd, 1914. Ducky seems to have been a progressive member of the team as it was documented in the Umpire that he entered a protest because he thought that a new bill to play ball five days a week, and to work a half day on Saturday discriminated against the Shed team as they would not be able to partake in some of these games. The reason for this is unclear. However, the idea of an inmate protesting speaks to the rights of the inmates being respected in ESP at this time. This is evidence of the new ideas of treating inmates in a humane way.

Here is a comic depicting Ducky going to the second base. It is not clear why the caption is followed by a question mark as advancing to the second base usually benefits the team. This could be because the newsletter reports that the Shed, Ducky’s team lost to the library on this day. However, it seems to have been an intense game as it reports that with a score or 2 to 1, Ducky was in a good position to turn the teams luck around. However, this did not happen. It could be that the question mark was a questioning of Ducky's capabilities by other members of his team.

## <center> Edward Franklin aka Jingles </center>

Inmate B6388, Edward Franklin, the infamous Jingles frequently posted articles, poetry and interview segments in the Umpire. He was the only prisoner to have this inmate number. He was born on December 17th, 1887 in New York, NY. Edward resided in Philadelphia, PA and was taken into custody on the 1st of Nov 1912 which aligns with timeline of when this poem was written. Before being convicted for a 2-year larceny sentence, he worked as a Book-keeper. He had attended both public and private schools. Given his previous career and education it is no wonder that he was interested in making numerous poetic and articulate contributions to the Umpire. This shows that ESP was actually creating meaningful mediums through which prisoners could find agency and express themselves. 

Bookkeeping a career that is now automated was once done manually by an individual like Edward Franklin. The job entailed keeping track of items bought, sold or given on credit. Bookkeepers often make entries that have a description and monthly profits and losses making it a time - consuming process.<sup>[4](#investopedia)</sup> As businesses were often small, business owners did not need complex accounting systems and accountants to keep their books. When Edward Franklin was a bookkeeper, the term bookkeeping was though of to be equivalent to accounting.<sup>[4](#investopedia)</sup> However, with the introduction of the railways that allowed for the development of distribution networks and the development of corporations, accounting and booking became separate professions. Nevertheless, around 1913 the U.S.  government bgan charging income taxes to fund the upcoming world war and this increased the need for accounts.<sup>[4](#investopedia)</sup> Given Edward Franklin was arrested in 1912, he would have missed out on a crucial time for his career. During this season of increase in demands for an accountant Edward Franklin would have had an abundance of job opportunities or the ability to take up accounting as a career. It is unclear, if Edward had the opportunity to do any of these things as there are no records of him after his time at eastern state. Regardless, it is clear that his bookkeeping abilities allowed him to use transferable skills to make great contributions to the Umpire.

## <center> The Rabbi </center>

The Rabbi whose name is currently unknown was a contractor at Eastern State Penitentiary who worked as an umpire in the Eastern State Penitentiary League. The newsletter contains the following comic of the Rabbi in action.

Though little is known about the Rabbi, we can infer that he was a man of African American descent as the Umpire speaks of him refusing an offer to umpire in the southern leagues as he was afraid of lynching laws in some southern states. His presence in the ESP league speaks to how ESP was ahead of its time in integrating black and white individuals in the baseball league. 

The umpire was an individual of authority in the baseball games and had a specific uniform as seen in the photo of the Rabbi, he seems to be wearing some sort of suit. In the early days, umpires were typically respected local figures like lawyers or doctors, and their uniform was formal, consisting of sober black suit, white linen shirt, black scarf ties, and a tall silk hat.<sup>[5](#SABR)</sup> This could be the hat that is depicted in the above comic of the Rabbi. There were no official uniforms at first, but as the game grew, changes started to take place which included the use of protective gears for umpires.<sup>[5](#SABR)</sup>In 1882, the American Association became the first league to enforce a provided wool blue suit as uniform for the umpires. The blue uniform eventually became the standard uniform for baseball umpires by the 1960s.<sup>[5](#SABR)</sup> By the 1913s, there was also the introduction of a wide range of protective gear for umpires such as  shin and toe guards, a face mask, new hats, breast and stomach protectors. In 1913, American League President Ban Johnson introduced alternate white flannel suits for holidays and presidential games, but these were short-lived. In the 1920s, lighter khaki suits and “peachy ice-cream outfits” were briefly introduced for umpires, but were abandoned after fan mockery.<sup>[5](#SABR)</sup> By the 1960s, with fans dressing more casually, umpires’ formal attire, including blue suits, appeared outdated.<sup>[5](#SABR)</sup> To modernize, in 1968 the American League introduced blue blazers and gray slacks, with optional blue shirts in hot weather.<sup>[5](#SABR)</sup> In the 1970s, major leagues started adopting similar attire, and the American League even introduced maroon suits in 1975. By the 1980s, standardization between the leagues was nearly complete, with both wearing blue blazers, gray pants, and inside chest protectors.<sup>[5](#SABR)</sup>

Here is a photo of Umpires for the World Series of 1924 lined up before the game.<sup>[6](#umpire_img)</sup>

During the ESP league, the umpires were instructed to follow a specific set of rules. They are seen in the April 13th, 1913 release of the Umpire summerized as follows:

These rules still apply to today’s games as they are the core principles of umpiring i.e. maintaining authority, fairness, and focus. However, technology has evolved to make abiding by some of these rules more manageable. For example, it might be less relevant to try to justify your decision as an umpire as new technology allows for instant replays and better communication between umpires.
