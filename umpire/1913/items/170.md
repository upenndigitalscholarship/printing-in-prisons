LIBRARY vs STOCKING SHED

The weakness of the Stocking Shed was
painfully apparent in their fielding on
Wednesday with the Library. Itseemed
as tho they could not hold a ball, and
when they did recover the ball, they
did not know what to do with it. We
were surprised at Fingers. A long fly
came out in his territory, and he mis-
judged it. ‘That was excusable; but
there is no excuse for a player who takes
his time in returning the ball to infield.
Blink should try and get the ball away
from him a little quicker. Ifyou do
not know where to throw the ball, do
not hold it, but throw it to some other
player who looks as if he knew what to
do with it. The Shed had new a south-
paw in the box and he held his own, but
Eddie Plank could not have won the
way the Shed fielded. Kggie pitched
for the Library, and in spots was hit
hard: in fact there was heavy hitting on
both sides.  Yellow led with the stick,
getting a home run and a double. Ban
putone over the Fifth Block roof for
a home run also. Big Whitey hit, what
for any other man would have been a
home run, he just managed to reach
third. ~ Ames for the Shed loafed on his
hit, and was held on second. Final
score 12—7 favor of the Library.LIBRARY vs STOCKING SHED
