GOT A LEMON

He was a poor and ragged tramp.

His hat was bad, his shoes were damp;
And, as he sped adown the street,

He looked about for aught to eat.

And, as he gazed into the air,
He saw a lady, passing fair,
“‘Passing for fair,”’ she was, all right—
He had to run to ask for a bite.
She turned and thrilled him with her eyes,
And extendeda palm that many would prize
And he saw, as he gave a painful lurch,
That the palm she had, was just brought
from church. -— Timmy, et al.
