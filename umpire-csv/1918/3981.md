MOTHER’S FACE    Three little lads in converse loud engaged,    One sunny summer day,    And out of the window low, I thought I’d lean    To hear what they might say.    “The prettiest thing on earth, I ever saw,”    One of the wee boys said,    “In Grandma’s garden was a lovely bird,    All yellow, black and red.”    “The prettiest thing I ever seen on earth,”    So spoke another lad,    “It is a pony at the circus grounds—    I want him awful bad!”    “I think,” the third bright little fellow said,    With unaffected grace,    “The prettiest thing to me in the world;    Is just my mother’s face!”
