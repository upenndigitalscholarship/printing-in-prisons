CHRISTMAS EXERCISES    Christmas will be ushered into this institution tomorrow morning at 6 a.m. when a detail from the Band will render a number of beautiful sacred songs appropriate to the day, from a position on the center. This will be followed by an “extra breakfast” at the usual hour, and at noon the Christmas dinner will be served, and consist of the following:    MENU    ROAST OF PRIME BEEF    Brown Gravy    MASHED WHITE POTATOES— MASHED TURNIPS    Fruit    Mince Pie    At 2.30 in the afternoon, the full E. S. P. Band under the directorship of Prof. Wiegandt will give a concert on the center, which promises to be one of unusual quality. The program is printed in another column, and includes some popular selections.    Many of the men will be favored individually by representatives of the different societies, while all will receive suitable reminders that they are not alone or forgotten. It is the purpose of the Warden to make the day as pleasant as possible for the men, and he extends to all his hearty wishes for a real Merry Christmas.
