We start off our Big Battling Show,
Introducing the Great
Who started the lark
By punching Ace Clark,
What kept him alive, we
don't know.

Next came Bill Murphy and Battling Don
Who put up a battle that was no “con”,
With no harm a-tall
They fought to a draw,
Mistake not these boys for a chocolate bon-bon.

Next comes our old sport Dick Pike,
But Dutch Morgan takes Dick for a hike,
Now this ain't so funny,
For they drew down first money,
And now're living high on whatever they like.

Now we have Joe Freeman and Charley Chase
The word Fights written all over their face
Not throwing the cattle
They put on a battle
That sure would add credit to any old race.

Then came Phil Cavan and Rebel Hogan,
A fight to the finish was these boys slogan.
But Cavan got his fill
From a few cracks on the gill
Which he thought was from Hogan's No. 10 brogan

The last act: Slugger McGuire and Spike McCann
But the fight was too short for any blood-thirsty fan
With a Whiff and a Bang, 
Slugger laid out McCann,
And this's all the fight dope we've at hand.
