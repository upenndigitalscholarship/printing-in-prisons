Circulating Library
Added to by Mr. Nelke

Christian Science services are
held in this institution every Tues-
day afternoon at 2:30, under the 
auspices of ""The Christian Science
Churches of Philadelphia and Vi-
cinity."" Although not soliciting
the attendance of any one, the or-
ganization does, however, welcome
to these services all who desire to
know what Christian Science is,
and those who want to learn how
to apply its teaching in overcom-
ing the wrong or erroneous thoughts
or conditions in their lives.

There is a circulating library of 
Christian Science books on 8 block,
including the text book ""Science
and Health, with Key to the Scrip-
tures,"" by Mary Baker Eddy.

All inmates are invited to make
use of this library at any time they
may wish to do so. Mr. H. L. Nelke
is Director of Christian Science ac-
tivities at this institution.
