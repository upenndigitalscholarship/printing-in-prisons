Coming Soon

Baseball will soon be transferred
to the South. Unfortunately we
will be compelled to remain North,
so why not join the Hot Stove 
League and plan for the coming
season here? What do you say
about having a team representing 
the various blocks and galleries?
This arrangement permits a great-
er number of inmates to engage in
this particular sport.

By the way, we used 4000 base-
balls last year. It certainly is a 
good thing that we don't leave the
finders of these balls in free.
