Rev. Smith Conducts
Bible Study Class

One of the activities not so com-
monly known is the Bible Study
class which is conducted every
Wednesday afternoon at 2 P.M. in
the Synagogue by Rev. Frederick 
Smith, the Lutheran Chaplain.

In this class there is exhaustive
study made, with the Bible as the 
only text book. The men are fur-
nished with study help sheets one
week in advance of each class in
order that they might have a bibli-
cal background before coming in
for the lecture. A round table dis-
cussion follows each study and
many of the men are unquestion-
ably receiving considerable benefit
from the study.

The popularity of this class
among those who are acquainted
with it may be attested by the fact
that the group at the Farm came
out 100 percent on a day when one
of the World Series games was be-
ing broadcast and shown upon an 
electric scoreboard.

Any man in the institution is
welcome and will find the Rev. Mr. 
Smith to be more than willing to
confer with him on any problems
that might arise, and that are with-
in the scope of a Chaplain's work.
On Wednesday, February 14, the
class will begin their studies of the
Confessions of the Church.
