A Philosopher

To take things as they be—
That's my philosophy.
No use to holler, mope, or cuss—
If they was changed they might be wuss.

If rain is pouring down,
An lightnin's buzzin round
I ain't a-fearin' we'll be hit,
But grin that I ain't out in it.

If I get deep in debt,
It hasn't happened yet—
And owed a man two dollars, Gee:
Why, I'd be glad it wasn't three.

If some one come along, 
And tried to do me wrong,
Why I should sort of take a whim
To thank the Lord I wasn't him.

I never seen a night
So dark there wasn't light
Somewheres about if I took care
To strike a match and find out where.
