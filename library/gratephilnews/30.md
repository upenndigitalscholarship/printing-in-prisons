Marines bow to Farm
Nine in Ten Innings

Kelly and Whitey hit timely to
nudge Leathernecks, 9-8

After almost giving the game away in
the ninth and tenth innings, the All-
Stars kept on their winning way with
a three run rally in the latter part of
the tenth that nipped the U. S. Marines,
9-8 in a thrilling battle.

The Farm nine was leading 5-1 going
into the eighth inning, only to have the
Leathernecks shove over a brace of tal-
lies in that frame and come back with
three in the ninth and tie it up after
the Stars had also counted in the
eighth.

The game appeared hopelessly lost
when the Marines notched two more
markers in the tenth on Kilroys double
and three consecutive singles by Gear-
hart, Henry and Tolan.

Smitty singled and Eddie walked with
nobody out in the last half of the tenth
to give the Stars a new lease on life,
out on rollers to Sullivan at third.
Whitey got one of the runs back with
a solid single that chased in Smitty and
after Willey walked to fill the bases,
Kelly drilled one through the infield to
send in Hddie and Whitey with the
tying and winning counters.

Meehan continued his murderous hit-
ting, knocking off four straight bingles,
with Kelly getting two besides that
game winning single in the tenth. Every
member of the All-Star nine had a hand
in the hitmaking, however, with the ex-
eeption.of Frank and See Mack,
who walked.

The Marines were also in a hitting
mood, hammering Ray and Nixon for
fourteen safeties. Tolan, Gather, Sulli-
van, Edwards and Rusnick each had two,
while Shardie, Kilroy, Gearhart and
Henry chipped off one apiece.
