Rangers Drop Close
Tussle to All-Stars

F. Rip’s single in seventh enables
Farm to win, 2-1

F. Rip’s single in the seventh inning
enabled the All-Stars to slip through
with a 2-1 victory over the Rangers and
extend their winning streak to four at
Graterford recently. The blow broke up
a neat hurling duel between Johnny and
Antosh, for the visitors.

The Farm nine broke a scoreless tie
in the fifth when J. Rip crossed the
plate, but the Rangers tied it up in the
seventh on hits by Jakeson and Antosh.
That set the stage for the winning up-
rising in the latter half of the same
canto. Meehan pumped a single and F.
Whitey walked to put men on first and
second. Meehan romped home with the
deciding tally on Rip’s one bagger.

Johnny hurled brilliantly for the All-
Stars, fanning eleven batters and per-
mitting only four hits. J. Rip led the
attack for the victors with three hits,
while Meehan, F. Rip, J. Reds and
Johnny each chimed in with two.
