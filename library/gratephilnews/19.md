"My Creed

Oh Lord in Heaven strengthen my will
power
To attend to my own business.
I beseech of Thee wisdom to enable
me to
Be more tolerant of my fellowmen.
To stop looking for faults and to see the
Better nature of those who come in
contact
With my daily life.
Each day, Father, put it in my heart
to do
At least one good deed in behalf of a
Fellowman.
Teach me that there is good in every
living Creature.
Make me realize that more can be gained 
by
A sincere smile, than a superior and
arrogant
Attitude.
Instill in me the desire for wholesome
thoughts
And to ‘‘do unto others, as I would have
others do unto me.’’
To speak well only of others, and to
refrain
From criticizing the indiscretions of my
Fellow-Humans.
And finally at last, Dear Father,
I earnestly Pray of Thee when I am
called to the Judgment Day, I will be
able to look back upon my earthly
Journey, and say that my life has not
been spent in vain. —Anon."
