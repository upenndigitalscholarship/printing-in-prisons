Father Farley Plans 
For Another Mission

Father Farley, Catholic Chap-
lain of this institution, has complet-
ed plans for another Mission dur-
ing the Lenten Season. The Mission
service, lasting an entire week, will
be conducted by the Rev. James P.
Clark, CSSB.

The regular Holy Name Mass
will be held Sunday, February 25,
at 5:30 A.M., with Confessions be-
ing heard Saturday morning. On
the other Sundays of the month, 
the Catholic Services will be held
at 9 A.M. in the chapel.

There are religious instructions
every Sunday, while individual in-
structions are given any time dur-
ing the week. The Chaplain's of-
fice is open at ALL times to ALL in-
mates of the institution.
