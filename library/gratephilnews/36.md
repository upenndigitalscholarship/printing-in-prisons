The Squared Circle

Now that Barney Ross is welter-
weight boss, it is logical to expect Tony
Canzoneri will be the light-weight king
again... Me thinks Barney can’t make
the light-weight class ... That is, with-
out hurting himself... It is rumored
the ""old master,"" Billy Petrolle, is
attempting another comeback ... That
means trouble again for those in, or
near, his class ...

Caught in the air... Steve Hamas
will be one of the principals in a Tay-
lor and Gunnis heavy-weight card in
September . . . His opponent has yet to
be selected . . . But don’t be surprised
to see Walter Neusel, the Teuton Ter-
ror, in the opposite corner... A new
set of boxing rules should be put into
effect to match Maxie Rosenbloom’s
style of fighting ... . They should be
called Slapsbury, or Slamsbuty rules . .

One of these days Slappie Max is
going to get himself jammed WhO es
It’s about time the boxing solons
straightened out the three following
classes .. . Flyweight ... Bantam...
And Feather ... Hvery individual clique
has its own champion . . . Almost as
bad as the wrestling champions . . .

Bat Battalino is touring South Amer-
ica . . . It is reported he is doing well
... A true warrior’. . . May a right
never cross his chin. . . Jimmy Wilde,
one of the greatest little fighters to don
the padded mittens, is now a fight man-
ager in London . .. Luis Firpo, once
dubbed the ‘‘ Wild Bull of the Pampas,’’
is now a tamed Holstein... His latest
weight report is 340 C.O.D. ...

Jack Dempsey’s greatest victory over
the public was his defeat at the hands
of Tunney ... That fight won him mil-
lions of fans and admirers .... Paulino
Uzcudun is classed. as a dontonder for
the heavy-weight crown in Europe ...
To us here he’d make a swell catcher for
the Cincy Reds . . . Sid Terris’ greatest
assets were speed and a lightning jab
... His biggest handicap ... A weak
chin ...

The Carnera-Baer fight stirred the
boys to a high pitch here ... And, as 
after every important fight, there was
the usual ""I told you so"" ... The
Italians were downcast like they have
been since the downfall of the Roman
Empire... But let it be said that a
more courageous fighter never lived ...
Good luck, Primo...

Were the girls happy after Baer’s
victory ... Don’t ask me ... Ask the
girls ...
