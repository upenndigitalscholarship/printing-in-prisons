		<h1>In 1929, Graterford Prison was built just outside the city of Philadelphia. It was meant to be a more "modern" penitentiary, compared to Eastern State Penitentiary inside Philadelphia, by then a century old.</h1>

			<p><em>Pen Points</em> (Volume 1, Issue 1) is dated February 14, 1934. <em>Grate-Phil News</em> (Volume 1, Issue 5) is dated July 3, 1934. This suggests they were both published monthly. They have similar mastheads, stating that they were published, and probably printed, at Eastern State, most likely by the incarcerated men who worked the printshop. They also share a similar layout as four-page general newsletters circulated within the prisons. However, unlike the earlier issues of <em>The Umpire</em>, they do not appear to have been edited or written by those incarcerated there.</p>
