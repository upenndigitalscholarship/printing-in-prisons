CON-FAB
by L. J. Biancone

GRAPEVINE GRIPE

Under the 1955 rules and regulations governing
the filing of applications for clemency to the State
Board of Pardons, applicants are now required to
file these forms two months in advance, instead of
the former thirty day period. The logic behind this
procedural change was apparently well founded.
The new rule affords more time for processing so
that every case that reaches the Board will be thor-
oughly investigated, as well as processed through
the institution’s Staff Board.

As this Staff Board is set up, the members are in
daily contact with their charges, either directly or
indirectly, and a complete log is kept on each pri-
soner throughout his entire period of confinement,
which includes a periodic check of the inmate’s
work record, conduct, and general progress toward
rehabilitation. This vast network of operations is
perhaps not perfect, if only for the reason nothing
is perfect; but in good conscience, the Board serves
the best interests of society as well as the inmates.
Nearly every session hosts a visiting interne, or even
a group thereof, representing various segments of
penal study, so that it is virtually impossible for the
Board to become complacent or biased. However,
the recommending powers of the Staff Board are
precisely that; ie., their recommendations are not
binding with respect to the State Board of Pardons,
which in turn makes its own recommendations to the
Governor, who is the only authority with power to
grant clemency. Under the State Constitution, this
power cannot be delegated to any other source.

Under this thorough-going arrangement, we can
look for better things to come, so to speak, notwith-
standing the unfair pressure from the licentious
press upon the Board of Pardons, and the inevitable
politicians who invariably like to ham it up at the
expense of human misery; not to mention this in-
justice heaped upon the men who are devoting them-
selves to the task of salvaging their fellow humans,
as a tremendous contribution to public service. And
what a record of contribution and accomplishment is
this Board’s! Of the 249 men commuted under their
setup, only 8 have returned to prison, and these
were for minor violations. RECLAIMING HUMAN
LIVES BEATS CLEANING UP THE SCHUYLKILL
RIVER ANY DAY. A word to the wise is sufficient.

However . .. in spite of the foregoing, this
column regrets to report that there is much to be
desired with respect to the period of time required
before final decisions are handed down by the State
Board of Pardons. Perhaps the delay can be at-
tributed to the recent salvo of unfair press criticism
of its operation. If we may borrow a phrase and a
favorite quote from the late F.D.R., we would sug-
gest a gallant stand on the record, and ‘‘Damn the
torpedoes! Full speed ahead!’’

LEGAL LOGIC

Until recently, the Courts in this State were
required to specify the particular institution to
which a defendant was being committed. However,
through new legislation, The Hastern and Western
Correctional Diagnostic and Classification Centers
were established, and the Courts now are required
to commit state prisoners to either the EDCC or
WDCC in leu of a specific penitentiary. The
“Center’’ takes over from there and decides to
which institution a prisoner will be transferred.

Some legal experts hold that, in view of the new
setup, the Parole Act which makes it mandatory
that the parole violator serve the unexpired portion
of his parole before serving any new sentence to
the same institution from whence he was paroled,
has now lost its mandatory force by reason of the
fact that a defendant cannot now be legally sent-
enced to any specific penitentiary, but only to one of
the Centers.

The writer does not profess to be skilled in the
science of law, but it would seem like a good step
toward the rehabilitiation of prisoners of this type,
parole violators with new conviction sentences, if
they were simply committed under the new sentence
first—which can now be done—and at the expiration
of the minimum term, when parole is considered,
parole could be withheld temporarily in lieu of re-
commitment under the old number to serve the
back time left from the original sentence. It would
certainly, at the least, be an incentive for an early
adjustment upon which any effort toward rehabili-
tation is predicated. Such a policy would then
make the prisoner eligible for parole at any time
thereafter, subject, of course, to the Parole Board’s
discretion. This pattern was followed in a few sim-
ilar factual situations with remarkable results, and
we hope it will be adopted as standard procedure.
(Note: The writer would stand to gain nothing
if the above were adopted as a set policy. In no
way could this policy apply to his own ease.)
