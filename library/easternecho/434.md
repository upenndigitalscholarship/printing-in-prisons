SUMMER OF 1959

THE EASTERN ECHO 

As we go on with the story of truth and gustice, we
might remember Carl Sandburg’s form of oath and a witt-
ness's reply:

“Do you solemnly swear before the everliving God that
the testimony you are about to give in this cause shall be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?”

“No, I don't. I can tell you what I saw and what I 
heard, and I'll swear to that by the everliving God, but the
more I study about it the more sure I am that nobody but the
everliving God knows the whole truth, and
if you summoned Christ as a witness im
this case, what He would tell you would
burn your insides with the pity and the
mystery of it.”
