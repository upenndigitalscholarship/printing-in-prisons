The Sun Also Rises

Sun Ra is a pianist, most of whose profession-
al life has been spent in Chicago. He has a repu-
tation as a musical eccentric. For his upcoming
New York debut he well present a group, easily
eccentric and much in the tradition to which he
has become accustomed.

According to his own publicity, Sun Ra has
now become Le Sun Ra and he is leading his
Cosmic Space Jazz group (Incidentally, Ra was
The Egyptian sun god, so the name, while re-
dundant, is certainly Emphatic).

In any case, Le Sun Ra plays piano and “sun
harp”, so the press releases state. And with him
are Bernard McKinney, Trombone; Tommy
Hunter, Drums; Pat Patrick, Baritone Sax and
Flying Saucer; Marshall Allen, Alto Sax, Japa-
nese Flute and Morrow; John Gilmore, Tenor
Sax, and Zebra Drums; and—hold on now—
Ronold Boykins, Bass and Fire Place.
