REALLY LIVING
by Sammy Snyder

A bit of love, a foolish tear
A photograph that one holds dear
A soft caress, a kiss or two
And eyes that seem to laugh at you
A careless wish, a dream you plan
A pretty girl, a handsome man
A wedding ring, then gain a wife
A baby or two to round out life
A heart inside thatâ€™s always giving
And when you gain them all
You're really living.
