IN PASSING

Just a few weeks ago the details of nine ficticious
offenses, along with presentence reports on the ‘of-
fenders’ were set down for the consideration of 50
Ontario magistrates. Even when based on exactly
the same facts, their dispositions ranged far—in one
case, from probation to 14 years imprisonment.

As a result, it often seems that an offender’s punish-
ment is determined less by what he did than by what
court tried him. Even when this impression is com-
pletely false—and sometimes it isn’t—there’s always
the danger that disparate sentencing will undermine
the concept of equal justice and bring the law into
contempt. ae
