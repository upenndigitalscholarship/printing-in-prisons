A CONFLICT OF WANTS

“All I want is for people to tell me what they want done with prisoners. If they
want them punished, I'll try to punish them. If they want them reformed, I'll try to
reform them. If they want them confined, I'll try to confine them.

The only thing is, people must realize that they can’t have their cake and eat it
too. If you want a man rehabilitated, you can’t concentrate on punishing him. When
a human being is punished he becomes resentful. Our orthodox criminal program is a
peculiar combination of punishment, restraint and halfhearted attempts at rehabilita-

These forms are all in conflict with each other. They generate friction. They im-
pair efficiency."
