Editorial - - -

When I first considered the challenging responsibility of editing this publication
I was troubled by the thought that we of the Echo staff were but one small voice. I
reasoned that perhaps such a small voice wasn’t worth the work and worry that goes
into our Echo.

The duty of the Echo’s editor is to present a compound picture of prison and prison-
ers to society with a view to promoting better understanding and communication be-
tween the two. As an individual, my duty lies in not compromising my beliefs. My
duty to Eastern’s inmates is to present them to the public in a truthful, yet pro-
pitious light. Mix all these duties together, add institutional censorship and you
begin to get a picture of the editor's dilemma.

Looking at the obverse side of the coin, two basic reasons prompted me to accept
the position:

(1), while it is true that we are only one small voice, that voice is multiplied by
the hundreds of members of the penal press throughout the country. Collectively
speaking, the penal press has an impressive circulation;

(2), and even more important, we are being heard!

The April issue of Harpers (one of the country’s leading class publications) carries
a special supplement entitled ‘Crime and Punishment.” It is encouraging to read
that the Attorney General of the United States, the Director of the Federal Bureau
of Prisons, the Police Chief of Chicago, a lawyer, a novelist, a doctor and an academi-
cian are expressing essentially the same opinions that the penal press has been print-
ing for years. Six talented prizewinning writers from ‘inside’ were represented in a
special section of the report entitled “The Voice of the Convict.” This writer was
particularly gratified to find his own views magnified in the article, ““The Poor Man
in the Scales.” Here Messrs. Ronald and Samuel Ribman, citing the Gideon Vs.
Wainwright Case, (a U. S. Supreme Court Decision which guarantees the right of
counsel to indigent defendants) have ably drawn the public’s attention to the in-
adequacies of our system of justice.

When a nationwide publication with a very selective circulation, can not only
admit that we have problems but show their interest in our problems by seeking
solutions to them, then somebody does care! And because somebody cares we of the
Echo staff will go on working and worrying our way to press.

On behalf of the Echo staff, I want to say, “Well done, Harpers.”

We who live in this great country are too often less than kind to those who would
view our social institutions with a critical eye. Many of our citizens are unaware
that our treatment of offenders has not advanced as far as that of other rehabilitative
areas. Perhaps the day will come when we judge the culture and the civilization of
a society by the substantial gains made in its treatment of offenders.
