Echo
pays a
glowing tribute
... it’s Christmas
wrapped and ribbon
bound. We’re
hoping you'll open it
rather early . . . with old
and new friends gathered round.
Surely in some
bygone issue ... there's
a word that touched your hearts
... for your thoughtful comments gave
us courage ... that sincerity alone imparts.
May we say how much
we thank you, extra specially,
somehow .. . for reaching depths of
understanding revealed to us, so clearly
now. Yes, concordantly, we thank you ...and we
hope throughout the
coming year ... much rich laughter,
joy and blessing . . . will insulate and make
more dear such nice friendships we have gathered
throughout this majestic continent . . . and many, too,
across the ocean . . . please accept our compliment . . . a Sincere
Merry, Merry Christmas
From all of us ...
to all of YOU!
