WHO’S HIP!!

A hipster was approached by a seemingly
‘wood joe’? and asked to compile a brief sketch
on Hip and/or Jive talk. Whether or not I qualify
to wax eloquent is debatable, but I do have a chance
to air my opinion, such as it may be, on a much
abused subject.

In countries the world over, there are expres-
sions peculiar to them exclusively. This applies,
too, to all walks of life; but slang, of indeterminate
and infinite scope, is the ‘‘scape goat’’ of all
those that don’t ‘‘dig it’’.

Since I’m inclined to embellish my speech with
these allegedly ‘‘hip’’ expressions, perhaps I make
much ado about nothing; but slang has its place
in our culture, as well as baseball or basketball.
It’s crude, you say? But, isn’t it picturesque,
robust, so vibrantly alive, also?

Just as we, Americans all, employ different
colloquialisms almost everyday, we should view it
(slang) objectively, and not be so condescending in
our regard for it. It’s vital, fresh, but this above
all, ‘‘It’s American’’. So later for you daddy, and
so much for that.

Bear, the Square.
