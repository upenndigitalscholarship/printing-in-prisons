Editorial:

In our view of the ‘compulsive criminal,’ we are not seeking to discover what
motivates these individuals or the possibility of a cure. It is their legal rights
that interest us and that we feel should be brought to the attention of our readers.
Is it right that an insane person should be brought into a court of law and sentenced
for an act, the significance of which is impossible for him to understand? We hardly
think so.

Yet, in almost every one of our courts we find this same thing happening day
in and day out. When we use the term “insane” we are speaking of the individuals
who are mentally ill and yet not psychotic. It should be obvious that not every men-
tally sick person is a drooling idiot, and that they are capable, to some extent, of
understanding the difference between right and wrong.

However the law remains stubborn and insists that there be some criterion by
which to judge their insanity. Unfortunately there is no black and white in the field
of criminal insanity. Rather, there are subtle shades of gray, ranging from the klep-
tomaniac to the rape-murderer. In the following pages we have tried to show the
history of the trials that set the patterns for both prosecution and defense. To be
equally fair, there are also two articles by men distinguished in this field, who offer
entirely different views concerning the trial of the mentally ill.

Further on there is an article discussing a problem of vital interest to the
groups in the Pennsylvania area that advocate a modern system of penology. The
author presents the question of whether the commonwealth should invest its monies
in a new maximum security prison that will insure, to the best of man’s ability, the
confinement of the sentenced criminal, or should the taxpayer’s dollars be invested
in a new minimum security institution; one that will bear fruit when the prisoner
returns to society as a working member of the community.

Those of our readers that happened to glance at the masthead on the contents
page will note that James “Mike” Smith has retired as editor. For several seasons
Mike handled the publication of the Echo with a diplomatic and intelligent approach
that will be hard to replace. His efforts toward making the Echo a part of progres-
ive penology were certainly of the highest calibre. We are certain that he will be
greatly missed by our readers, but we hope to continue to merit your interest by
maintaining and improving upon the standards of previous issues which were well
received. Since the editorial reins are yet rather new to our hands, we shall partic-
ularly welcome your suggestions and comments as an indication of your belief that
our magazine does have some influence in advancing penal improvements.
