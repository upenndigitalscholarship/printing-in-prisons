Dear Mr. Banmiller:

Enclosed you will find my check for a subscription to
your very interesting magazine, (THE EASTERN ECHO)

As a former player, (now a rooter due to the inroads
of age) I wish to express my thanks for an enjoyable
afternoon, I’m referring to the softball game between your
team and McGeehans of Mayfair. Everyone in our group
had a grand time, and we are looking forward to a return
match. I sincerely hope the inmates enjoyed the game, for
actually that I assume, was the prime purpose of arranging
the contest. I noticed with interest, my Company, The
Bell Telephone Company, had played a basketball game
with your boys.

I could not close this brief letter, without mentioning
the article by Andre L. Paschedag, (The Quality of Mercy)
was terrific, an entirely different slant than we are used to
reading in our local newspaper.

I have taken the liberty of writing for our group,
because as so often happens, we enjoy ourselves and never
take the time to express our appreciation.

George Hartley

Dear Mr. Hartley:

We are glad to add another friend to our subseribers
list. Each new reader gives us one more outlet, to whom
we can express our problems and our views.

The MeGeehan’s softball team, of Mayfair was very
well appreciated by the entire inmate population. To us,
here in ESP, it was a great event. As you know, your
group was the first group of softball players ever admitted
to these grounds to participate in softball. It is only the
beginning of a new era in modern penology. We hope it
will not come to an end, but go on to a better understanding
between we, the inside, and you, the outside. Come back
soon, maybe next time your team will emerge the victor.

Andre Paschedag, (THE QUALITY OF MERCY) ex-
pressed his pleasure, at your mention of his article. He
exclaimed, ‘‘People are beginning to understand. Thank
Mr. Hartley for all of us.’’

Editor

Dear Mr. Cuff:

I read with great interest the article in the ECHO by
Andre L. Paschedag on ‘‘THE QUALITY OF MERCY’’ and
relating imprisonment to punishment for murder. I con-
gratulate the writer on an excellent article which shows
balance, restraint, understand‘ng and clarity. This is a
tremendously controversial study and the article is most
important.

I’ve been in this work for more than forty years and
therefore appreciate the presentation. I am enclosing a
statement presented before the Judiciary Committee of the
New Jersey Assembly recently in support of a measure to
abolish capital punishment. I thought the ECHO might
be interested because it is presented from both the point of
view of the abolition of capital punishment and the relation
of the problem to youth and juveniles.

In its introduction the article tells of my relationship
to this field. I should make the point clear although I am
now connected with the Philadelphia Youth Service Board,
I do not speak officially for the Youth Services Board or any
other government agency with which I have served as staff
member. I read your excellent journal with appreciation.

Leon T. Stern

Dear Mr. Stern:

Letters from our outside readers are always grate-

fully received, as they are the only gauge by which we can
measure the effectiveness of our small publication. Natu-
rally, we value most of such letters as yours which find some
worth in our efforts to present the problems of the inmate
from a different viewpoint.

Your enclosed statement was read with much interest
by the entire ECHO staff, and, while we do not completely
agree with all its facets, we do wish to comment and thank
you for your efforts as a free citizen to open new approaches
to the problem of criminology and penology. Society has
a great need for citizens who are willing to contribute their
time and effort toward the solving of a rapidly growing
social problem,

The writer of the article you mentioned in your letter
has asked us to convey his appreciation for your comments.

In closing, may we once again express our gratitude for
your interest and our hopes that future issues of the
“ECHO’’ will contain further features which will help
develop such friendships as yours,

The Editor and Staff

Dear Editor:

I am always pleased when the EASTERN ECHO arrives
in the mail. Your writings always have depth to them.
They let us (outside) know the other side of the story.
Too often, people believe only what they read in the daily
papers, without taking time to get the facts of the other
side. I would like to see more people in free society
subscribe to the ECHO, only in that way will they begin
to understand that prisoners’ are ‘‘human beings.’’ That
prisoners can be rehabilitated, and will come back to society
better citizens, if only they (society) will take time to
understand. Thank you for a wonderful magazine, and
keep uy the good work.

Mrs. H. Kolb

Dear Mrs. Kolb:

Letters, such as yours inspire us. Many times we are
inclined to believe that we are hammering our heads against
a stone wall, we believe that we are not being heard, and we
wonder why we should continue. It is letters such as
yours, which give us the will and the strength to continue in
our work. Someday the stone wall will crumble, and we
will have gained our goal, our ‘‘Bridge of understanding’’
will be complete.

Joseph Cuff, Editor

Dear Friend:

Received your ECHO magazine. I really cannot express
how much I enjoyed it. Your articles and stories were
wonderful, especially the composition for Mother’s Day,
“A Bouquet of Words.’’ I congratulate you.

I show your ECHO to a cousin, Father Michael Brown.
who looks it over for possible pointers for sermons .

I am a great lover of poetry, that is one reason I enjoy
your magazine so much,

Mrs. Marie Dugan

Dear Mrs. Dugan:

We hope that our future issues of the ECHO, will
bring you as much enjoyment as our past issue. As you
know, the poem ‘‘A Bouquet of Words’’ was sent in by the
Mother of one of us. We thought it was the ideal poem for
the occasion. We are always pleased when we are told our
work brought enjoyment to one of our readers.

THE ECHO STAFF

Dear Henry:

We really enjoy reading the ‘‘ECHO’’ You fellows
certainly put a lot of hard work into your magazine. I
enjoy the stories and the poetry page very much. Jesse
Burch, must be a very impressive fellow to write such poetry.

Marty, Jean & Boys
Tooele, Utah

Marty, Jean & Boys:

When we know that our work is pleasing to others and
brings them to enjoyment, it gives us the incentive to work
even harder and make our ECHO even more enjoyable.

Jesse Burch is a very impressive fellow, and puts a
tremendous amount of energy into composing his poems.

Henry Myers
