The University of Pennsylvania won the College
League Tournament and we won the Industrial League
Tournament. Scoring honors went to James Ryder, who
had four wins, two draws, and one defeat.

RESERVE SECTION

The Reserve Team’s performance was not on par
with previous performances because of the inexperience
of the players. At the start of the season, our team
had many seasoned players who, for one reason or
another, had to be replaced by players with little or no
experience. These fellows gave a good performance!
