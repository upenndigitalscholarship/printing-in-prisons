ANTICIPATION
by
Frank Rouse

To us it seems the day will never come;
The day that we can shed our cloaks of sorrow.
Sometimes it’s even difficult for some
To force themselves, to strive to face tomorrow.

And surely it comes; another day of plight,
With a concentrated urge to lift the gloom.
But still a relief from our anguished filled night,
Where we teetered on the endless brink of doom.

We must dismiss such miseries, a daily ritual.
“Cooperate,” it’s said, and our future we'll enhance.
So forget about that high, gray wall;
Let’s wait, it’s coming, we'll get another chance.
