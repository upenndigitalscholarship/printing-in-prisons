WEEPING WILLOW 
A willow weeps on a sunny day 
And its shoulders droop in a helpless way ; 
Great sobs shake its breast without a sound 
And soft falling tears litter the ground

The mystery of why the willow tree weeps 
Is something that Nature selfishly keeps ;
And only God, the Great Sculptor of all, 
Does know the secret of why the tears fall.

THE WEB

The spider arduously
and with great skill
patiently spins a web
in which it might trap
the unsuspecting insect or fly;
while man, possessing
the qualities of goodness and truth,
deviously spins a web
of greed, hate and tyranny
throughout the universe ;
but . . . unlike the spider,
which devours its victim to survive,
man becomes the victim
of his own web
and ultimately destroys himself.

FOR YOU

May dungeons deep and walls of steel
Never contain, nor eâ€™er conceal,
The priceless words that one may write
On silent wings of friendly light ....

I write for you, O distant friend, 
These hearty words, and pray they'll send 
Your lonely heart to pastures green;
Your precious soul to heights serene.

A temple built with heart sincere
Will ever take your footsteps near
That bridge of gold o'er tranquil streams
Of love and joy, and rhythmic dreams.

And then perhaps down sunlit lanes
Where angels walk and wisdom reigns,
You'll one day find that sacred shrine
Where prophets drink love's mystic wine.

There symphonies of love will play 
And kindred souls will kneel to pray, 
That each on wings of song may rise
To love's unconquered paradise.



A big head is a structure
supported by
a narrow-minded foundation ....

A mailed fist of revenge
could be the inverted weapon
of self-destruction . . . .

SKYSCRAPER

I believe a skyscraper 
does more than symbolize 
man's architectural genius . . . .
I believe it is the manifestation 
of man's inherent desire 
to ascend heavenward
and beyond the stars,
that he may look upon the countenance of his Creator.
