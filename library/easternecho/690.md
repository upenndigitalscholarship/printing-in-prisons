Editorial:

For countless centuries it has been the dubious privilege of minority groups
to act as the butt for the wit of humorists, and while we inmates—the world’s
smallest minority—enjoy a good laugh, we would like some sort of counterbal-
ance that would let the public know that only a few prisons employ the proverb-
ial sledge hammer and rock-pile of the cartoonists and comedians of our day.

Inmates in this present age have acquired skills that should stand them in
good stead when they are released, but the image of cons making “little one’s
out of big one’s” has captured the public fancy to such an extent that few busin-
essmen. will give the parolee the chance to even demonstrate his abilities.

It becomes a paradox when you realize that these same businessmen,
through their taxes, are subsidizing the institutional vocational programs—pro-
grams that are comparable in scope to outside training schools—and yet will not
hire the products of the program that they have established. Confusing?
Definitely !

The obvious solution would be to project the true image of inmate labor into
the minds of the public. But what news value is there in the fact that John Q.
Convict has mastered the intricate wiring of IBM Panels or has learned the com-
plex trade of Linotype operation? When it comes to prison labor, the only tale
that will create a stir among the communications media is that a parolee jug-
eling the books or some similar happening. Sandwiched between the lambasting
of the front pages and the lampooning of the comic section, convict labor ap-
pears a tasteless dish and does not have a chance to tempt the appetite of the
employee-hunery businessman.

This does not mean that there are no “defenders of the faith,” for a few
people do recognize the practical value of using prison labor when possible.
However, their voices are usually confined to the pages of magazines that do
not reach the general public or the prospective employer. When it happens
that a favorable article on prison labor does appear in the dailies, it is usually
a human-interest piece that does nothing more than draw comments of “how
quaint!”

What we inmates need is an effective propaganda that will bring our voca-
tional skills before the public. Such a plan would need the concerted efforts
of all our friends and the financial backing of an organization such as the Ford
or Rockefeller Foundation. If these organizations can afford to pour millions
into surveys of social conditions and crime causation, their charters should have
means to furnish the necessary funds for a group that will be trying to combat
one of the major causes of crime—and refusal to hire the ex-con is definitely a
factor in the increase of criminal statistics.

Some may think such a plan grandiose, but it lacks only a leader with the
determination and perseverance to carry it through. UHyppolyte Vilain, John
Howard, Dr. Benjamin Rush and Thomas Mott Osborne had the courage to pi-
oneer in new fields of penology in their era and we are sure that someone of their
ealibre will take up the gauntlet in this age.

While we wait for that man or woman, we need not sit on our hands. Our
families, friends, and sympathetic organ zations can write letters to the editors
of the dailies, asking that they look at the other side of the prison labor coin.
They should also study the state laws regulating labor inside their penal insti-
tutions, and where they find unwarranted restrictions, should complain to their
representatives in the state senate. Any action they take, no matter how small,
will be a giant step forward.
