WHY ISNâ€™T INSTANT COFFEE SOLD IN OUR COMMISSARY?

The sale of instant coffee, in several different types of packages,
was tried at various institutions of the Bureau. However, the problems
that were created by this resulted in the adoption of a Bureau Policy
removing instant coffee from the Commissary Lists at all institutions
and precluding its sale and availability.
