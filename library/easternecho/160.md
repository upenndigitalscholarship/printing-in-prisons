From the Warden's Desk :

There is a tendency in all walks of life, professions, and various fields to be
idealistic—perhaps that is as it should be. It establishes a goal for which to
strive. But I believe such idealism must be tempered with practicalities of
everyday living. Living with your fellow man in harmony is a matter of give
and take. Each person’s make-up is different from the other. We must learn
to understand that. Some men have not developed mentally and physically
as have others. Some were so limited at birth. Are we to condemn them for
something beyond their control? People can be unfair and even cruel to the
less fortunate. As an example: children in school, taunting a child who is a
born cripple, a condition over which he had no control. What defense has that
child? Don’t adults, who are supposed to have intelligence, do the same, only
with more vengeance and with more cruelty? Are they real men? Isn’t a
real man one who overlooks the weaknesses of others. .

Over the years, I have sometimes found men in prison who seemed to me
to have been more preyed upon than preying, more abused than abusing, more
condemned—than they deserved to be. The root of the trouble usually lay
in a weakness, a condition beyond the man’s control or scope of understanding.
For one reason or another, all along the line of his life no one had helped him
understand and control that weakness, though many had condemned him for
it. True enough, where crime is committed, the judgment of the law must
prevail. But after that, what? What can we do? I think a good beginning
is not to add to any further condemnation of such men, but to overlook. . . to see
but to overlook. .. their weakness and then—help them.

This same attitude can be applied, with suitable qualifications, to the rest
of imprisoned men. That is, to the normal majority. If not severely handi-
capped mentally or physically, perhaps they have not had their share of edu-
cational and vocational advantages. Perhaps for many of them, too, no one
eared. Shall we cruelly taunt this lack of education or training? Or shall we
be men and, overlooking what they lack, try to help them obtain it.

, I don’t believe there is any doubt but that prison programs have improved
over the past 25 years, particularly in the last 3 years with a coordinated Bu-
reau of Correction under a Commissioner. There is a coordinated effort to-
ward a common goal—there are definite programs to enable men to fit them-
selves for a useful life. There is an effort to educate the public that 95% of
men are sooner or later released from prison. It follows therefore that every
effort should be made to provide the means to enable a man to take full ad-
vantage of the programs to help him, by education, vocational training and
an acceptance through professional help of how he can become useful, how he
can accept reverses without reverting to old, bad and condemned habits.

All this is in the nature of help to the man. And in this, I believe.

William J. Banmiller, Warden
