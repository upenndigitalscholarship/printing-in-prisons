From
the
Superintendent's
Desk

Since the last issue of the Echo, we have added two new building projects that have
been long overdue; namely, the new inmate barber shop and the new visiting room.

The barber shop not only supplies additional physical space but also an opportunity
for a greater number of our inmate population to learn a trade that will help them
when they are released to normal life.

The new visiting room is more spacious than the old one. it has been, in the past,
embarrassing to have people come to visit in what | referred to as the “Black Hole of
Calcutta.” | believe it is unnecessary to even mention the contrast between the old
and new.

During construction and at the time of completion of these projects, you were
subjected to adjustments and inconveniences that were unusual. I want to thank all
of you for your fine cooperation and understanding.

Also, our thanks to the maintenance department for a job well done.

A. T. Rundle
