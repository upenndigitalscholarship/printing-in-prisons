SPORT NOTES

The handballs are “‘up,’’ bocce balls rolling, horse-
shoes flying and checkers being moved in great profusion.
To the participants engaged in those activities (too num-
erous to mention in the meagre space allotted) I offer
the excuse, albeit of small consolation, that trying to cover
the many and varied activities engaged in by the men here
over a six month period is pretty nigh impossible. As
many of you know, we are two issues in arrears of our
normal schedule. Now that the situation has been sta-
bilized, see you soon!
