Lo! the Holy Infant 
Born in Bethlehem, 
There borne by the Virgin Mary, 
As humble as a lamb.

He brought a tender feeling 
To the hearts of young and old,
For purity and mercy
Were born within His soul.

When He grew to be a man,
Was hung upon the cross,
He died for our salvation
To save that which was lost.

Hark, now! The Angelic chorus
Ah, my! they sound so sweet,
Let me but join the chorus
And walk the golden street.
