Building Down... Morale Up
by JESSE BURCH

William (Turk) Beaty, Robert (Mac) MeNeair,
Timothy Mumford, Douglas Chey, Melford Hagler,
James Gilliard, Claude Dublin, Levi Jones, Clarence
Pitts, are perhaps just nine names to you, but to
those of us here at Eastern, they will long be re-
membered as a symbol of unselfishness personified.

It all began, or rather the decision became final,
in the early days of this year. An assignment,
among many handed to the Chief Engineer, Captain
Joseph J. Roach, caused him to call upon the above
mentioned men. The problem, the removal of a
large, soot-covered, two-storied granite and steel
building, for the enlargement of the recreation
area. Ordinarily, this would not be too tough a
task, but, Eastern, is so constructed that machinery
of the modern style, needed to expedite rapid dis-
position of the old massive structure, is practically
impossible to import.

Captain Roach ealled the nine men together,
mapped out a plan which consisted mostly of using
what materials they had on hand, and getting the
job done as quickly as possible.

The sum total of ready tools were: Two Pneu-
matic Drills, Two twelve lb. sledge hammers, Five
picks, One (borrowed) ‘Hough Payloader’ (a small
lift truck, with scoop bucket) and eighteen willing
hands.

As you stand and look at this marvel of con-
struction, it is almost impossible to imagine, how,
the builders of this ancient structure, could have
mastered the lifting of the solid granite blocks, two
feet thick, and some of them six—to eight feet in
length. This is little, in comparison with the size
of some of the steel girders. When you think of the
sweat, muscle and precise planning it took to erect
such an establishment, it is and was easy to see how
it had endured the attacks of man and the elements
for the past 51 years.

The tonnage of the rock and steel, the mastery of
planning and erection was minute compared with
the persistence and determination these men dis-
played, in the completion of their task. Profes-
sionals (with the same type tools) could not have
done a better job.

Despite the fact that the drills were constantly
running at a very rapid pace, often changing hands
while still in operation and picks ringing against
stubborn granite, the casualty record was clear,
rest periods were few, and at all times, during the
working hours, bare hands clawed at the craggy,
obstinate building.

Fatigue became prevalent in the face of each
man, nausea from the dust and blisters plagued a
few, but in no way slowed down the progress of the
demolition.

The greatest hazard in the whole operation
was, the passers by, and the side-wall engineers,
but they too, had become infected with the zeal of
these nine. Occasionally offering a hand, and soon
wandering off, but the nine stuck to their task.

The greatest thrill as reported by one of the
men was, the cheer, that came from the onlookers
aS the last piece of reluctant granite crashed to
earth. The determination and grit of these men had
paid off.

Superintendent Banmiller, was more than lav-
ish in his praise of the men and immediately inau-
gurated a banquet to commemorate each man indi-
vidually.

Captain Roach, was as proud as a peacock, for
once again his theory had proven to be true: “Give
a man a task with an over-all plan, and a minimum
of supervision, and his own ingenuity will encourage
him to complete said task.’

“We, of the Echo Staff, can but say to each and
every one of you men that although we do not have
the facilities to inaugurate a banquet for you, we
ean tell others of the lesson you have taught us so
thoroughly: Unselfishness is to be found every-
where. We sincerely thank you for giving us a
personal definition of the word, UNSELFISHNESS.
