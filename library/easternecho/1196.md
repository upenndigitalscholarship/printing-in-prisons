A CONcept Of Constructive Elimination

by Norman Pearson

Through the years so much has been written and
said about rehabilitation that if it was compiled, it
would probably fill a library. So you have probably
heard most of what I am going to say, however, this
time, my remarks are intended primarily for the
powers that be. Unfortunately, people in position to
implement reforms so badly needed, haven’t quite
torn themselves away from the medieval concept that
time, and time alone, will cure the problem. Admit-
tedly, rehabilitation takes time but in this context,
time is an adjunct to, rather than the thing relied
upon to do a job it never has, and from all indica-
tions, never will be able to do.

As a person intimately involved, I’m a little re-
luctant to express my views on this matter; being
reluctant, I’m inclined to examine my views more
closely for ideas overly subjective. There is no guar-
antee bias won’t creep in now and again, but that’s
for you to determine.

There are many facets to this concept of Rehabili-
tation: political, social, financial, ete., but I would
like to speak as a man from the inside. It has been
my observation that the majority of men in prison
do not feel the officials are offering the help they
need. Before any meaningful reforms can take place
this thinking must be changed. I happen to think
the image of the cruel jailer has changed in theory
and to a large extent in practice but among the men
in prison there is a lingering suspicion and that must
be altered. How do we go about this transforma-
tion? Well, to begin with, I would like to sce a more
progressive system based primarily on merit, but
there must be more constructive things a man can
earn merits on. I don’t mean that just because a man
spends a number of years in prison without a mis-
conduct report this should be the deciding factor in
his release. For the most part this is the method
used now, mainly because the facilities for voca-
tional training which would allow for a more ac-
curate and realistic evaluation are very limited in
variety and scope. If the aim is to rehabilitate, as it
should be, the opportunity is being missed by the
present system. Other than punishment, very little
is gained when a man spends a number of years in
prison, no matter how good his prison conduct, if
after his release he is almost in the same situation
that more than likely contributed to his incarcera-
tion in the first place. Unless a system is devised
that will enable a man to obtain the skills and crafts
the market demands today, his chances of becoming
a productive member of society are not very good.

Close examination of most prison budgets will
show that large amounts of money are being spent,
with very poor results toward rehabilitation. Most
men in prison don’t have trades or means to make an
honest living once they are discharged. One sug-
gestion is that paroles and commutations be decided
more by what a man does in prison that will enable
him to earn a living when he is released, rather than
the so called “model prisoner concept,” which means
in most instances that he went along with the non-
existent program—i.e., he didn’t make waves. I hap-
pen to think most men in prison are there primarily
because of economical reasons. Very few are what
might be classified as professional criminals. This
might have been true in years past, but not now.

The program I have in mind might be termed
“Constructive Elimination,” in that efforts should be
made to eliminate the basic reason for a large seg-
ment of crime. Once a person comes to prison every
effort should be made to adequately prepare him for
his release date. This can’t be done on the assump-
tion that time alone will work some miracle. Pro-
grams should be set up in such a way that most pris-
oners are convinced these programs are geared to
help them and not necessarily a few people who talk
rehabilitation, but don’t really believe in it. The big
complaint among thinking prisoners is that there
aren't nearly enough trades being offered and the
few offered are incapable of training more than a
minimal amount of men.

Another aspect of rehabilitation is the adjustment
of men to prison life. A prisoner might have an ex-
ceptionally good behavioral record after a number
of years in prison but what is his potential for earn-
ing an honest living once he is released. After having
watched them come and go, I am beginning to have
serious doubts concerning the adjustment of men in
prison. Sometimes it appears they adjust so well in
our abnormal environment that it’s extremely hard
to adjust to a heterosexual environment. One can
see the need for a certain amount of regimentation
and order but in the final analysis you have got to
deal with the individual. This is where the contra-
dictions emerge. How does one maintain a sense of
independence, if for a number of years every deci-
sion is made for one? I think the people trained in
the behavioral sciences, Psychiatrist, Penologist,
Psychologist and Sociologist, should be given a more
prominent place in all phases of correctional work in
prison. This is not to suggest the officials who have
spent considerable time in prison work haven’t per-
formed in accordance with methods and ideas open
to them under the existing system, but it should be
abundantly clear by now that the present way of do-
ing things has failed miserably.

Once all the facets of rehabilitation are imple-
mented and coordinated, I have no doubt the results
will justify the money spent and efforts put forth.

It is a dilemma to be sure but one that must be
solved if the problems of rehabilitation are to be sur-
mounted, and recidivism reduced.

Half measures we got already! What is really
needed is a dedicated commitment to rehabilitation.

It has been said that time heals all wounds. In
this case It ain’t necessarily so!
