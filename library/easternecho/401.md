WE CAN DO BETTER

The generous donations of blood to
the Bloodmobile, during its visit of
December 23; 1958, were greatly appreci-
ated, as evidenced in a letter received by
Dr. Nathan Blumberg from the American
Red Cross representative. It read in part:

‘‘Dear Doctor Blumberg:
‘‘Thank you, your staff, and all the
wonderful DONORS, who helped make
the Bloodmobile visit of December
23 1958, such a fine one—of 143 pints
of Blood!
“You will never know, how very
important this was, at this Holiday
Season—so we are doubly grateful
and want the DONORS to know of
our appreciation of this help to those
needing blood in the hospitals!
“We wish you a Very Happy New
Year and thanks again to all of you
at Hastern State Penitentiary.’’
Gratefully and Sincerely,

(S) Mary T. Foster, Volunteer Blood
Chairman, Central Branch, ARC

The total amount of blood donated
was an increase over that of the previous
visit. Congratulations to all who partic-
ipated in this effort and who share the
expressed appreciation of those who will
benefit by such generosity.

The Bloodmobile will return for ad-
ditional visits and your contribution is
needed. et’s all get into the act and
make the next total an even greater
one. —J.M.
