INMATESâ€™ 23rd PSALM

Do unto others before they do you.
The Warden is my keeper; I shall not talk back;
He maketh me to lie down in 15 Block.
He restoreth my visits; He leadeth me into court;
Yea, though I walk in the shadows of Fairmount Avenue;
I shall fear the Parole Board.
Surely, guards will follow me all the days of my stay;
And I will dwell in this - - - - house of numbers forever,
Ah-h-h women.
