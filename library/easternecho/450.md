ers interested in its cause, presented Jabez “Bud” Harding of the Salvation Army, with a check in the amount
of $92.00 for the purchase of a new uniform.

In the presentation, the chairman cited Mr. Harding for his unselfish and sacrificial devotion to the
cause of the Church of the Emancipator, and above and beyond this, for his services in the cause of Christ.

Since the organization of the Church of the Emancipator here at Eastern two years ago, Mr. Harding

serving God.
