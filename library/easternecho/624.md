In his book NOT GUILTY, the late U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Justice
Jerome Franks writes of 36 actual cases in which innocent people were found
guilty.

“A man may be convicted when his only crime is that of being poor... this
is not true justice. It makes a sham of the great democratic principle of
‘equality before the law’ when that equality depends on the possession of a
well-filled pocketbook.”

“The ordinary treatment of witnesses is the least caleulated to elett
testimony that is accurate...tricks of the trade prevent the best humanly
possible determination of the actual facts; many of our practices often seriously
impede accused persons from presenting evidence that might persuade the jury
in their favor."

“We dare not assume... that innocent men will be safe from imprisonment
or the death chair ....”

Via. SPECTATOR, Jackson, Mich.
