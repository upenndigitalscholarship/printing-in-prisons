CONVERSATION

Penal Press Quotes

‘‘Speaking of motivation, we wonder if lack of
motivation isn’t what causes prisons to fail. All of
us—doctor, lawyer, merchant, thief—are motivated
by reward. The reward may be spiritual or phys-
ical, but there must be some reward if we are to do
anything.

“The biggest reward you can offer a man in
prison is release. But how in thunderation can a
man in prison work for that reward? ...

“We believe that if somehow society could tell
aman: ‘‘You get yourself straightened out in prison
and we’ll let you go,’’ prisoners would be breaking
their necks trying to straighten out their lives.
The present non-reward system whereby a repent-
ant, wholly rehabilitated prisoner often does more
time on a lesser offense than, say, a good con-man
who spends his time planning new crimes, is hardly
one that promotes motivation.

"Actually, there are rewards to be gained—
mostly spiritual ones—by a man in prison. But
these are so distant that. it takes a very mature man
to recognize them. Prisoners aren’t known for
their maturity. What we need is more immediate,
more tangible rewards if our prisons are to serve
us properly.’’

‘‘Some people think it an essential part of life
to be able to do things similar to what someone else
is doing. This concept is an error when the efforts
to act like another person are directed so exclusively
to accomplish the end in mind that values and ideals
are forgotten; in other words, when an individual
becomes so anxious to copy a neighbor or a friend
that he forgets the purpose lying behind what is to
be accomplished, the thing in itself then becomes an
error, Since one’s efforts are directed toward an
objective achievement rather than the embodiment
of worthwhile values and ideals.

‘‘Emerson said that the great man is the in-
dividual who ean live in the complexities of the en-
vironment in which he finds himself and can still
subscribe to his ideals; in other words, he keeps the
independent point of view which he could easily
maintain were he to live in a world by himself. This
is an example of putting into practice the courage
of our convictions, to uphold the beliefs and loyalties
to which we have subscribed so that our fellow men
may see in our behavior that the ideals which we
from time to time talk about have a depth greater
than the mere repitition of words and phrases which
often are hollow and carry no meaning.

‘‘It is, of course, essential for every intelligent
individual to analyze impartially the basis of. his
convictions. These convictions would be established
on principles which have been arrived at through
an analysis of true value. To express merely the
opinions of someone else or to accept certain doc-
trine or dogma that some other individual or group
of individuals may have established is not to use
our own ability and right to establish convictions
that have the sincerity of individuality and true
idealism.”

THE FORUM

‘‘Both history and statistics show that punish-
ment is not a deterrent to crime. The punishment
of criminals has been on trial for several thousand
years and as crime is still growing stronger it would
seem that the theory of punishment, for punishments
sake, having failed to halt, much less eliminate
crime, is not effective. You can prohibit murder
and robbery, or any phase of crime until you are
blue in the face, but you won’t get anywhere until
you go back of the effects and tear out the roots of
the cause.

“Theory and laws, in so far as they are estab-
lished for punitive purposes only, will never do any
good. Theory, as far as it relates to the criminal,
has already proven itself a dismal failure. Need
knows no law. This business of punishment en-
masse gives no warrant of hope that will solve the
problem. It is valuable only to such a degree as it
diverts the responsibility from society for the
moment.

“If improvement is impossible under the pres-
ent laws, so much the worse for the laws. And if
we do not know definitely how to attain results then
why not begin to learn. Even if it becomes neces-
sary to establish schools for experiments.”

C. S. McCabe, in AGENDA
