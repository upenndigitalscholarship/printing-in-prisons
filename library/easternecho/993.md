IN THE A. A. CORNER
Joe S.

A film was shown in the Chapel on Monday
evening, May 11, 1964, and everyone was
welcome to attend. This movie titled “Through
A Glass Darkly,” concerned the alcoholic
or "problem drinker” and his tendency to
become enmeshed in the toils of the law.

Statistics show that of all parolees who are
returned to prison, the majority are returned
because of drinking. The abuse of intoxicating
drinks plays a major role in populating our
penal and health institutions.

Approximately 70 men viewed the film and
most remained for the brief discussion period
which followed. Jack, a guest speaker from
an outside A. A. Group, spoke on the film
topic and conducted a question and answer
session.

Our A. A. Sponsor, Chaplain S. E. Barnes,
urges anyone who has had a drinking problem
to read the interesting and challenging
"Memo To An Inmate” pamphlet, as well as
other assorted A. A. literature, available in
the Protestant Chaplain’s office.

Chaplain Barnes invites everyone to drop
in kis office to discuss the real benefits of
our A. A. program and attend a few meetings
to investigate for themselves.
