Editorial.....

FOR SOME TIME NOW. OUR CITY AND STATE FATHERS HAVE FREQUENT-
LY ARGUED OVER THE SOLUTION TO THE HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL QUES-
TION, “DO YOU THINK THIS INSTITUTION SHOULD BE TORN DOWN?”

UNFORTUNATELY, THIS SEEMS TO BE A TOUCHY PROBLEM FOR THE INDE-
CISIVE DECISION MAKERS, WHO CONSTANTLY RELEGATE IT TO THE “CON-
SIDER SOME OTHER TIME” FILES, THUS LEAVING IT UNRESOLVED. WITHIN
THESE PAGES, OUR ROVING REPORTER PRINTS THE ANSWERS OF A FEW OF
OUR INMATES AND THEIR REASONS FOR ANSWERING AS THEY DO. HOW-
EVER, WE FEEL THIS QUESTION IS OF SUCH SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE,
THAT WE HEREWITH PRESENT OUR EDITORIAL VIEWPOINT.

THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT UPON THE
ANSWER TO ANOTHER QUESTION, “WHAT PURPOSE SHOULD THE PRISON
SERVE?” IF YOUR ANSWER IS THAT THE PRISON SHOULD SERVE AS A PLACE
OF PUNISHMENT, WHERE SOCIETY CAN CLAIM ITS DUE RETRIBUTION FROM
THE IMPRISONED BY MEANS OF IMPOSING A BARBARIC, TORTURED EXIS-
TENCE, A PLACE OF DEPRIVATION AND MEAGER, UNSANITARY CONDITIONS,
—THEN BY ALL MEANS, ALLOW THIS MEDIEVAL, ARCHAIC MONUMENT TO
THE DARK AGES OF SADISM, TORTURE AND WITCH BURNING, TO STAND AS
IT IS; IT CAN CERTAINLY SERVE THIS PURPOSE QUITE WELL FOR ANOTHER
150 YEARS.

HOWEVER, IF YOUR ANSWER IS THAT THE PRISON SHOULD SERVE AS A
PLACE OF REHABILITATION THROUGH EDUCATION, TRAINING FOR OCCU-
PATION, PSYCHIATRIC AND MEDICAL CARE AND UNDERSTANDING; A PLACE
WHERE AN INMATE CAN RETAIN HIS SELF-RESPECT AND THUS REGAIN A
HEALTHY ATTITUDE TOWARD THE RULES AND LAWS OF SOCIETY, ENABLING
HIM TO QUICKLY READJUST HIS METHODS AND THOUGHTS SO AS TO CON-
FORM TO THE ACCEPTED NORM AND BE A SOCIAL CREDIT RATHER THAN A
SHAMEFUL, WASTEFUL DEBIT; A PLACE WHERE A MAN CAN BUILD CONFI-
DENCE IN HIMSELF THROUGH INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNAL CREATIVE EF-
FORT THAT WILL ENABLE HiM TO MAKE GOOD USE OF HIS PREVIOUSLY MIS-
DIRECTED INITIATIVE—THEN TEAR THIS OUTMODED, INADEQUATE PLACE
DOWN TO THE GROUND LEVEL, AND REPLACE IT WITH A NEW MODERN,
WELL EQUIPPED “REHABILITATION CENTER” THAT HAS THE FACILITIES TO
ACCOMPLISH THESE AIMS OF THE MODERN, KNOWLEDGEABLE PENOLOGISTS
AND AN ENLIGHTENED, HUMANE SOCIETY.
