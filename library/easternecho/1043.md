“Trout Season”

Q. What did Noah say when he caught his two sons fish-
ing from the Ark?

A. “Take it easy, boys; you know we only have two
worms"!!!!!

Two old Indians, who had not been on speaking terms
for years, decided to go fishing the first day of Trout
Season. Mumbling never over a word or two, they packed
and set forth. Since both had “twinges — in — the —
hinges’ (arthritis), they took along their Knap Sacks
(sleeping bags). With the rising of the sun, they cast
their lines. Soon one caught a beautiful mermaid. He
quickly hauled her in and looked her over quizzically.
In a few seconds he threw the gorgeous creature back
into the stream.

“WHY?” madly screamed Indian No 2.
“HOW?” mumbled the other frustratedly.
