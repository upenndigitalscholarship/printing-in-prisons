INTO THE SEASON:

At ’em boy’s: The Dodgers continue to march to first
place behind the pitching of Big Dave. The Braves, due to
astute managing by P. Locke, and stellar pitching on the
part of Kalvitis and Massanova, hold a strong second, with
designs on first place.

The Giants, with steady fielding and good team spirit,
vaulted out of the cellar into thir place in hot pursuit of
the Braves and Dodgers.

The mighty Falcons, not feeling their might, and still
smarting from successive defeats in three games played
against the Dodgers, are cellar-dwellers. However, with a
fighting spirit and deep pride, coupled with important
changes in the Falcons organization, warning is served to
the front-runners; Look Out! Have Wings, Will Fly!

May 16—G.I. Joe fired himself as fie]d manager of the
Falcons and chose William ‘‘Billy” Hollowell as his sue-
cessor. Since Hollowell took over the Falcons seem to have
found new life. They took 4 of 6 from the Giants and 2
out of 6 from the Braves. Under G.l. they lost six straight
to the league-leading Dodgers. Now their slogan is, we’ll
get them!

May 27—The high-riding Dodgers have hit a bump in
the road. They have lost three straight and now realize
everything that shines isn’t gold.
