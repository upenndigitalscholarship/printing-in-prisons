“The necessity or usefulness of capital punishment as a deterrent to crime
has never been demonstrated,’’ asserted Wilbur G. Katz, former Dean of the
University of Chicago, as he addressed 200 lawyers, judges, law teachers, clergy-
men, and students of the U. of C. law school a few weeks ago.

"Prison wardens and others in the best position to know,’’ he continued,
‘‘are strong in urging the abolition of capital punishment. I join them in this,
because of my conviction that Christian principles forbid the use of any
penalties which serve no purpose.”
