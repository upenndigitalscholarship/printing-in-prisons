DESERVING DINER’S

On January 27, 1964, in the Officers Dining
Room, thirty-five inmates were assembled for a spe-
cial dinner in recognition of their particular service
to our entombed society. These thirty-five men form
the 3 Block entourage of the medical staff. Blood-
sucker’s, pill-pushers, Enema Nightingale’s—what-
ever we fondly call them, this steak homage was de-
served and earned by the hospital crew.

A full complement of medical personnel were on
hand in the person of Doctors:
Nathan Blumberg — Medical Director
Armando Goracci — Surgeon
Robert Frantz — Staff Physician
Phillip Marone — Staff Physician

The correctional body of the institution was re-
presented by:
Alfred T. Rundle — Superintendent
Joseph Brierley —- Deputy Superintendent
Thomas Graham — Director of Treatment
Sergeant Ronald Marks — Custodial Super-
visor of the hospital

From the brief talks given by the men cited above,
sincere appreciation of the inmates hospital duties,
well performed, is the axis off which overall hospital
harmony is seen to prevail.
