POINTERS FOR WRITERS

Five points of advice to practitioners seeking to
improve their performance in related types of writing:

1. Edit, revise, and rewrite your copy (not just once
or twice, but many times).

2. Show your copy to someone else.

3. Don’t be sensitive about having your copy edited.

4. Continually collect and store information from
your reading.

5. Be committed to your assignment.

The better and more experienced you are, the more
likely you are to ponder what you’ve written——to edit
it, revise, perhaps rewrite it. You look at your copy
critically, as though you had never seen it before, as
though someone else had written it——someone you
don’t like very much.

Being sensitive about your copy is a characteris-
tic of amateur writers. Anyone who is sensitive about
having copy changed——who defends copy on principle
——-is being unprofessional. Everyone in the writing
business, from the best to the least, has his copy edit-
ed. A writer can improve both his disposition and his
performance if he adjusts to this fact.
