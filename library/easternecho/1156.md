RED DEVILS

The Red Devils, owned by Leonard Massey
and managed by “El Snako’’ Welty, took the field
eight Saturday mornings and had one victory, one
forfeit and six losses to show for their efforts. This
fact, in view of some superior playing personnel, -
baffled the fans and opponents alike. To illustrate,
such men as “Shaky’’ Colwell, Ray Thompson, Ed
Scoleri, Ronald Lomax, “Big Chief’ Custalow, Bob
Kingsley, Charlie Butler, Gil Collins, Andrew Lopes,
Al Sheppard, John McCandless, “Hillbilly,” Ray
Bullock, Warren Zachary, Jay Morton, Carmen
Spina, Will Bagley, Bill Kennedy, Les White, Bill
Rice, John Jones and Terry Ross, are all consider-
ed more than adequate, as football players go, here
at ESP. The mystery, then, is “Wha hoppen?”’
Whatever the answer to that question may be, I'll
give credit for effort, if nothing else. Better luck
next year, Devils!
