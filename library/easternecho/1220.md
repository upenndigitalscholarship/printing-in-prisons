WHAT A FRIEND I HAVE IN—JOHN

Good old John, he’s my pal.
He sure saved me when I lost my gal.
Sometimes when I can’t sleep at night,
He makes sure that I’m snug and tight.
Or when I wake up feeling bad,
John turns me into a jolly lad.
My friend I'll always serve.
Because he’s 100% clear nerve.

Once in awhile John gets down,
Take care of that with a trip to town.
Man, I'll say, when you got a friend,
Best to do, is stick with him to the end.

Have to admit, I’ve seen some sights,
From sitting with John most days and nights...
Why, tell you what I’m going to do,
Just invite you over for a little brew,
For I thank the day that I was born,
And got to know, John Barleycorn.
