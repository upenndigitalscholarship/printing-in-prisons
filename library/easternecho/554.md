INJUSTICE SEEN IN SENTENCES

The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, for Sept. 21
carried the following Associated Press dispatch from
Los Angeles:

Assistant Attorney General Warren Olney said
today Federal records show a “shocking” disparity
in the length of sentences imposed by different
judges for the same offense.

In an address prepared for the University of
California Law Sehool Association, Olney said the
justice department is studying possible steps to bring
about greater uniformity in the sentencing of federal
law-breakers convicted of similar crimes.

“No matter how one looks at these cases,” he
said, “and no matter whether one believes that the
light sentence or the heavy sentence was the proper
one, the presence of inequality, disparity and con-
sequent unfairness and injustice is plainly apparent.

“Such cases have a very corrosive effect on any
program of rehabilitation for those convicted of
crime, and the presence in a penal institution of pris-
oners who have such utter contrasting sentences cre-
ates an extremely serious institutional problem.”
