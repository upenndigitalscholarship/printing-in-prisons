From the Superintendent's Desk

In the athletic world an individual sets certain goals to attain. A
baseball player attends spring training to prepare his mind and body for
a rigorous summer schedule. Professional football players begin in the
summer to prepare their minds and bodies for a rough fall schedule. Like-
wise, in the fall professional basketball players are sharpening their
minds and bodies for a long, tedious winter season.

While we may not reach the point of perfection in physical conditioning
that the professional athlete attains, it is necessary for us to be in good
physical condition. Along with this we must condition ourselves mentally
for the street.

This mental preparation cannot begin one day, two days, or three days
before we are being released. It must begin at the time we enter the insti-
tution. We, like the athlete, must set a goal for ourselves and train to
meet that goal.

There are ample opportunities for you to engage in a training program to
revise your thinking and attitude toward life. Help is here; people in the
various departments will point the way. YOU are the only one who can
carry yourself over the finish line.

Begin today.
