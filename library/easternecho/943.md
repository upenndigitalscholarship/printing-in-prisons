Our Football Season opened on Sep-
tember 28, 1963 with Big Mack’s Blue
Giants taking on the Giant-killing Pack-
ers. The results of the game were:
Packers, 25; Giants, 0. While the Pack-
ers, managed by Lujack, were reason-
ably well organized, the Giants blared
out a din of confusion leaving the score-
board at the mercy of Lujack’s backs,
Pinky, Richie and Socrates Cantoral.
Big Mack’s Giants would again suffer
the penalties of dissention among a
squad on the field. Packer Quarterback
Harry Zietz capitalized brilliantly, if not
amazingly, with the highest score this
institution can remember against the
Giants (55-0) at a later date. The Pack-
ers, however, weren't Devil-killers, as
Teasey Brumskill adequately reports on
the game which ultimately decided who
would prevail as Champions.
