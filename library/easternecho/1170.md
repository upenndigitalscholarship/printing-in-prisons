LYNX

After dropping their: first two decisions, owner Joe
Knowles of the Lynx, completely revamped his team. His
first move was to bring George Miketish out of a short
lived retirement, to do the actual field managing. ‘‘Mac,”
as most of us know, has pitched more teams to champion-
ships than anybody else around. His powers of persuasion
must have been pretty strong to bring S. Cantoral out of
years of retirement, but to see him hold down the key-
stone position, one finds it difficult to believe that he ever
stopped playing. This is a solid team with Hank Rutledge,
Tom Orlando, Richard Torsel, Russell Pieffer, Bob Fisher,
Willie Bagley, Joe Coler, Richie Richardson, Frank Wholey
and “Hillbilly,” hustling and hitting to keep the team in
contention. At this writing the Lynx are in second place
behind the Mets bidding fair to take over the league lead.

“Smiley’’ is to be complimented for the astute dealings
that strengthened his club and made them contenders after
a disastrous start.

OWNER & MGR. Joseph Knowles
