BASKETBALL CHAMPIONS

The Shockers defeated the Apaches for the 1965
basketball championship. Outstanding personnel on the
championship team included: Herb Allen, John Welty, Ray
Walters, "Preacher" Anderson, George Pal, Terry Ross
and Jones. The three-game playoff was an exciting, hard
fought series in which the superior all-around play of the
champions ultimately asserted itself. Credit due too, to the
following players of the losing team: “Big Six’’ Connors,
“Rosy” Minter, “Cochise” Bell, Eddie Brooks, Harry Zietz
and Bob Kingsley.
