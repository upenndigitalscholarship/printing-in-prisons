BULLETIN

Phila., Pa - Sept. 15, 1964
(From the Philadelphia Inquirer)

Judge Leo Weinrott — on Monday — ordered
a new trial for a 41-year-old former South Phila-
delphian convicted of burglary in 1942.

The Judge granted the petition of Arthur Bruno,
sentenced to 7 to 15 years in 1945, after deliver-
ing an opinion blasting the U. S. Supreme Court's
decision on which the prisoner's petition was based
(Gideon vs. Wainwright). . . .

Weinrott’s decision noted that Bruno was sen-
tenced in 1942 without counsel, as was often the
practice then.

The Inquirer noted that Judge Weinrott said
that he feared the impact of the Gideon decision
on the administration of justice generally and
hoped it may be changed. Yet it left him no re-
course but to order Bruno retried.
