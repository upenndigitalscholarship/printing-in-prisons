The World I Never Made

I pause... for a moment to rest, for I see the spectre of a lonely soul take
leave of a forgotten self and weave a trail out into the nowhere ... Yes, time, like
a kindly magician... pauses... for a moment to rest... that I serene, may gaze
where only unlit sunlight had been before...

Roll back! Yes! Roll back, ye mighty days of time to powers that were,
return as mine...

Summer that came in suddenness ... murmuring ils arrival, lacing a surging
of hearts into oneness... blossoms illuminating the dusky places with a white
laughter ..

A sun had lost its blazing glory, retreating in a flanung chariot before a war-
like blue of a soft-lit might ... blankets of blue triumphed, laid themselves across
a tired-eyed sky ...aday sellled down to slumber ...a busybody moon, a gardenia
im the mght's buttonhole ... stars glitlened, stars on which to hang the curtains of
night ...

A whispered, weeping sigh, a silent voice... “and thow beside me singing in
the wilderness” ... one beloved of Omar, swept across Persia land .. . sweet sighs
of mingled ecstasy...

Oh wretched hour, I taste my bread of pain in a garden of agony, a Gethsem- 
ane of untold pain ...amoment frittered away... for want of a star a dream was 
lost ...

The summer sleeps in a dreadful depth ...

Awaken out your forceful slumber, oh winter ... cold and blustery deep...
That we may gather, one by one, the cold-nose snow and hated sleet...

The bigness of a love came forth, the struggle at last past ... Blessed Savior,
in a forgotten world ... A people crazed with indignation, tinseled crepe paper 
twined around their ears... Death, death to the impostor ... and I, in a crystalline
pensiveness, turned away... An angered wind blew citt the lamp of mind...

Now, to sink back into the oblivion from whence I came, for words are but
little toy actors, ranting across the paper, brandishing tin swords ...

Yes...time...like a kindly magician ... paused... for a moment to rest...
and having rested, moves on...
