THE CHAIR’S PLEA

O’ Lady of ultimate Justice
Extending your mercy rare,
Lend ear where“the,ash and the dust is,
To me your electric chair.

For yearseighave faithfiily, striven
To serve as your perfect tool
While death’s embrace I have given
The famished, the weak and the fool.

Each life you have called forfeit, I fried it,
Indulging your, lust to kill,
Each qualm that brought torture I'd hide it
While serving your iron will.

My soul is now weary and sick of
The common blood you abhor,
It yearns for what I’ve had no pick of
And thirsts for a richer gore.

I’m tired of the spawn.of.the cutter,
The fool and the drunken rake,
I’m sick of my bread without butter
And crave for a Human cake.

O Harlot of Death, change my diet,
Add spice to my bill of fare;
Tradition’s enslaving, but try it—
And send me a millionaire.

—George Melden
