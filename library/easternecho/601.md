ODE TO A LIFER

A lifer’s insight which finally ends up out of sight. The first five years he
becomes INSTITUTIONALIZED, understanding what you can do and what you
can’t do. The next five years is spent becoming MOBILIZED, finding a job
that’s interesting, and becoming aware of the daily tasks ahead. The next five
years, which is fifteen, makes him DEMORALIZED. His incentive for a new
life is now gone. The next five years he becomes PETRIFIED, hardened to prison
life mentally and physically. Upon being released after five more years, he is
STUPEFIED, because at last in the minds of the board he has become rehabili-
tated. And now he is FRAGMENTIZED to a mere shell of a man.

—Wilham Baity
