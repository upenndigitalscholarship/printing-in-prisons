WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR? 
by Binford H. Smith

WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR? Is ‘‘re-social-
ization’’ or socialization the penological objective?
Or is retaliation still the objective of our penal system?
The Judicial and Administrative bodies are, in prac-
tice, not always in agreement in this matter, we
observe. And the unenlightened public—plagued by
misleading news stories—create a burdensome prob-
lem for those conscientious persons who earnestly try
to ‘‘advance’’ the practically nominal resocialization
program. Resocialization is a momentous and ex-
pensive project, and its supporters are the public.
But does one really subscribe to something they know
nothing about? Or distrust? The public hardly ever
associates resocialization with penology, yet, this is
the theoretic penological objective. The merit of
this corrective theory, resocialization, is a funda-
mental Christian concept; it postulates the essential
goodness in all men.

However, resocialization facilities are, at most,
but preparatory to the delinquent’s communal re-
integration. And, in following this plan of penology
to its practical objective, parole is an indispensable
implement in the most important phase of the de-
linquent’s ‘‘rehabilitation’’—his social adjustment.
For the promising citizenry of our hopeful, en-
lightened penology cannot be fully realized within
the walls. The negative element of its own in-
herence—the prison environment—cancels out this
final phase of developement. Only in the element of
its objective—civil life—can this penological propo-
sition be reasonably achieved. Therefore, the con-
ditional citizenship afforded by parole should be
encouraged.

The many prominent citizens who have sponsored
and employed parolees know that the parolee, more
than often, tries extra hard to gain a respectable
status. The general pattern of parole violation in-
dicates that very often, too often, the recidivist is
driven into anti-social activities: ill-will shown to-
ward him, rejecting him as a member of the com-
munity, is tantamount to assigning him, to his former
habitat—the undesirable, the anti-social. Why do
communities sometimes respond in this unreasonable
manner toward one who is trying to win their
acceptance? They have been ‘‘educated’’ that the
eriminal, offender and ex-offender alike, is a diabolical
species of animal; these unenlightened people—fortu-
nately they do not constitute the majority—would
abolish parole; ‘‘exterminate’’ the offender. Perhaps
in barbaric communities ‘‘extermination’’ for the
offender is a moral practice. But in this civilized day
and age, the only corrective measure justifiable is
resocialization. 

Editorial charlatans who ridicule parole would
really be doing a public service if they directed their
energies toward trying to promote a better under-
standing of this inexpensive and efficacious institu-
tion. Parole is not an amnesty. Parole is a very
‘‘calculated risk’’. The inmate’s efforts toward self-
improvement, his behavior, all the things that con-
tribute to the sum that he is, are computed to de-
termine whether or not he will be a ‘‘good risk’’.
And statistics prove that he is, in 9 out of 10 cases.

When, regardless of the inmate’s efforts toward
self-improvement, the parole board rejects his appli-
cation for parole virtually because he has a previous
criminal record, or—notwithstanding its deterrent
value—due to the nature of his case, the penological
objective is defeated by its own deviation of purpose;
the inmate becomes discouraged and is likely to quit
the ‘‘futile effort’’; furthermore, his distrust of
‘‘administrative practices’’ taint the morale of other
inmates; such an atmosphere certainly doesn’t serve
the penological purpose. If our penal system does
not practice the philosophy of its own preaching .. .

But then, the publie’s biased attitude toward
parole and the corrective institution in general—be-
cause they are not fairly informed—is largely re-
sponsible for this ‘‘defection of purpose’’. Society
must be served. If the public was more enlightened in
this area of civic activity much more progress could
be made.

Foremost among the contributing factors of this
‘‘dilemma’’ is the Newsmonger. He exploits the
news-value of a story. He is the ambitious and/or
unscrupulous reporter who heedlessly fashions his
subject matter—human being—into the creation of
his own prejudice. His slanting or coloring of
“‘human dramas’’ often infringes on the ‘‘rights’’
of the person or persons involved. A person should
not be tried before his trial, and this is what many
sensationalized news stories amount to. Likewise,
the newsmonger exploits cases involving parole vio-
lation and recidivism; they do not cite the fact that
parole violation amounts to a mere 11.5% and that
approximately 5% of parole violators are returned to
prison for simple infraction of the parole stipulation,
e.g., Staying out late, failing to make the required
periodic report, ete.

The preceding facts certainly reflect the efficacy
of parole. But then, the minor repercussions of
parole are not news-worthy. This sort of news enter-
prising is largely responsible for the current con-
fusion of the old penological philosophy, ‘‘An eye
for an eye and a tooth for a tooth’’, and the modern
penological philosophy, ‘‘resocialization.’’

Unfortunately, the social sciences, particularly
the phase with which we are here concerned, is far
from being abreast with the sciences of nuclear
physies or Sputnik-ology. But a greater effort in this
direction can certainly promote the cause of ‘‘en-
lightened penology’’, and only our news media can
effect this, by fair presentation—especially in relation
to parole.

Socializing or resocializing programs—psycho-
therapy, vocational, academic and recreational pro-
erams—help build sturdy character, but real social
maturity can only be realized in a social environment,
and parole is the means whereby this can be
accomplished.

The expedient of parole is the most promising
corrective of penology (statistics maintain this) and
should be encouraged as concientiously as the ‘‘atom
protege’’ of the last decade.

Or is vengeance still the aim of penology? If
so, then, our Penal Publications and our greatest
proponent, Mrs. Public Relations of the Penal Press
and First Lady of the thousands of ‘‘exiled’’ men and
women in this country and abroad, DOT SCHEER,
and the Joe Paulls, Ray Whittakers, Charles Shaws,
Portia Perrys and Thatcher Longstreths, and num-
bers of others whose civic-mindedness and commend-
able efforts toward creating a better understanding
between the public and the ‘‘rehabilitating Inmate’’,
and dispelling the Newsmonger’s leading. misinfor-
mation—that stigmatizes and impedes the resociali-
zation program and the conscientious delinquent’s
progress; the anathema of penal and corrective
progress—are laboring in vain, and the whole science
of MODERN PENOLOGY is an inane humanity,
a prodigal expenditure.

Do we practice the barbaric philosophy that
we condemn ?
