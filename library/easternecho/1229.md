A PRISONERS CREED

If I were asked to formulate, behind these prison walls,
A set of rules for just myself, to guard against pitfalls.
I would propose at very first to watch what I may say.
To do my time and mine alone, through every single day.
I never should concern myself with how another acts,
And if I must repeat a tale, be sure it’s based on facts.
If I can’t say just one good word of fellowship this day,
Then I would as soon keep quiet while going on my way.
I will not step on other’s toes by infringing on these rights,
By doing this I will be quite sure of keeping out of fights.
I will not be a ‘‘teller’’ carrying troubles to the man,
I'll solve my problems by myself, or do the best I can.
I will not criticize someone just because I think him odd,
I'll keep my eyes upon myself and leave the rest to God.
I will try to wear a smile all day from beginning to end,
Instead of making enemies, perhaps I’ll make a friend.
If these nine rules I try to keep and manage to succeed,
Then I will have a simple life by just this little Creed.
And if to these I add one more, to live for Christ each day,
Then time I spend behind these walls, will quickly pass away.

C. J. Oakes
