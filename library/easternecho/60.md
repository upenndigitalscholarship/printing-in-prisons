PARABLE

It may be true
that a rolling stone
gathers no moss,
but on a mountain slope
of cruel and malicious gossip,
it can create
a devastating avalanche
and crush forever
the edifice of a living soul....

REFLECTIONS

An egotist is a badly cracked mirror
reflecting the image
of a distorted personality ....

That person we adversely criticize
could be a mirror
reflecting our own characteristic defects ....

GIFT OF THE ROSE

I fervently take into my hands
and hold with reverent, tender care
the lovely rose, so red, so delicate,
of a grace and beauty so profound
that only one who loves—

may see it there.

Its delicate petals,
each time I hold it to my cheek,
resemble the soft touch of an angel
caressing my heavily burdened heart
with unrequited love ;
and only the Masterful hand
of the Sculptor
who eternally dwells above
could create such beauty
and place upon its blood-red lips
a nectar so sweet, and so divine,
that each time I sip
it is for my lonely, pain-wracked soul
a most blessed anodyne.

THE PESSIMIST

No angel choir will ever sing
for him in dark of night,
To make serene his tortured soul
and give his vision light. . .

The rising sun he never sees,
nor stars in heaven's crown; —
And on his face he always wears
a dark, depressive frown.

No thought of love pulsates us heart
that he may speak good cheer
To struggling throngs of suffering souls
in bonds of jagged fear.

Where beauty reigns he always sees
grim silhouettes in grey;
And crushing life with cruel contempt
he goes his tragic way.

BRIDGE BUILDER

Man constructs a bridge
of concrete and steel
over deep rivers, turbulent streams
and yawning chasms;
but finds it most difficult
to construct a bridge of love
over the chasm of hate he has created
between a neighbor and himself ....
