In 1910, when Winston Churchill was Home Secretary for the British
Commonwealth, he stated, and we quote:

‘‘The mood and temper of the public in regard to the treatment of
crime and criminals is one of the most unfailing tests of the civilization
of any country. A calm, dispassionate recognition of the rights of the
accused, and even of the convicted criminal against the State: a con-
stant heart searching of all charged with the deed of punishment;
tireless efforts towards the discovery of curative and regenerative
processes ; an unfailing faith that there is a treasure, if you can find it,
in the heart of every man.

These are the symbols which in the treat-
ment of crime and criminals mark and measure the stored up
strength of a nation and are sign and proof of the living virtue in it.’’
