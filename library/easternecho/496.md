A Felon’s Fable

Once upon a time there lived a thief without
respect. He wasn’t a big thief; but just a common,
ordinary, petty-type thief. One day while sitting
in his lonely room, he looked into the mirror. To
his disappointment, he saw the usual reflection—the
same watery, red-veined eyes; the same weak, slop-
ing chin; the same nondescript, unhandsome features
which had marred his personality from the day of
his unfortunate birth. Angry with himself, he cursed
the unwavering image with vile disrespect; for how
could he respect himself when he received no re-
spect from others?

With twisted logic he decided to affect a mate-
rial change in his personality by becoming a bigger
thief. He needed to be big. He wanted the respect
of his fellowmen, as does everyone—even as you or
I. So, he decided to become a bigtime robber. Never
having been a robber before, he naturally blundered,
and to his own horror, became one of the biggest of
thieves—a murderer. A thief of human life. Be-
cause of his inexperience in the field of big crime,
he was quickly apprehended. At first he was fright-
ened, but then—he saw respect in their eyes!

The reporters, the cops, the people—they all
stared at him with respect. He looked in the mirror
in his cell. Why his very image was different! He
was stronger, his eyes were clear and piercing, his
shoulders erect and muscular. Why, he was a big
man! Of course he was—didn’t they all watch him
with respect? Wasn’t he somebody?

Day by day, as the formalities dragged on, he
eloried in the new sensation; the wonderful feeling
that he was important. When he appeared in pub-
lic, all eyes were upon him; when he spoke, all ears
listened attentively. So, the trial progressed, and
because of his proud boasts, the little thief was sen-
tenced to die. Even now he was proud. Didn’t this
prove he was important? Sure! He was a big man
now.

As they strapped him into the chair, he watched
them coolly. He would show them how to die! Like
aman! Calmly, he considered his audience. He saw
respect in their eyes—the eyes of the lesser men
who watched as the guards prepared him for death.
Then his wandering gaze happened upon a mirror
across the room. He looked closer, eager to see once
more the strong manhood of his newfound person-
ality. As he looked, he saw a hand place the metal
plate upon his head. He saw the wires leading from
the wall to the chair. And as he watched, his image
grew paler. Death was near!

Suddenly, he was frightened, and in the mirror
his chin quivered and tears rolled down his slacken-
ing cheeks. He thought wildly, “My eyes are play-
ing tricks upon me!” Quickly, he looked about the
room seeking reassurance. The respect of the on-
lookers would prove the mirror was wrong. They
would prove that he was still important, still a big
man.

He found pity in the eyes of some. Disgust in
the eyes of others. A few spectators were staring
at him with undisguised hatred. Frantically, his
gaze raced across the faces of the other viewers.
This couldn’t be! They didn’t respect him! Their
faces showed every human emotion except love and
respect. They were watching him die, and they
didn’t respect him at all!

And as the black hood fell over his face, block-
ing his view, it came to him! He was a failure. A
big man had to be alive. You had to live to experi-
ence respect. And he was going to die. As the
thought thudded home to the very core of his being,
he collapsed. His shoulders slumped, his head fell
to his chest, and a wild sob of regret tore from his
throat.

And so he died—a little thief without respect.

Moral: The respect of others is only a reflection of
the respect you bear for yourself.
