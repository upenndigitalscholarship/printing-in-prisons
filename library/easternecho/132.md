STOP! LOOK! LISTEN!

In the May-June issue of THE KEYSTONE,
brother Penal Press publication put out by the
inmates of Western State Pen at Pittsburgh, this
editor’s attention was called to a reprint of CITY
OF W.S.P. which appeared in our Spring 1957
ECHO... and minus recognition of the source.

Any magazine has all the right in the world,
both legal and moral, to expect such souree and
author credit. So hat’s off to Wm. Dale Mitchell,
editor of KEYSTONE and author of the prose-poem
which appeared here under the title ANOTHER
NAME FOR TIME. The original version as written
by Mitchell also happens to be a superior piece of
writing. Thanks to friend J.P.R. for bringing this
to mind.
