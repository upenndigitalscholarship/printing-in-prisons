GEMINI IV

Once low-browed man-brute walked erect
From cave-dark depth into dreadful night.
There lifted his head and peered direct,
Fixing fierce wonder on Heavens lustrous lights!
Challenging past primordial night, by one round stone,
He heaved aloft, with superstitious strength alone,
And threw, marking manâ€™s first uncradled reach
Outward, into vacuums vast beyond belief!
Now conquistadors of different vizored mien,
Trust scientific thrust of rockets multi-engined might;
'Til bound by gold umbilicus they leap,
Brave colossi into the endless deep!
There unstanding, weightless they command
Star-struck strangers, in a new Darien.

by Richard Eichelberger
