PROFILE
by THOMAS WILLIAMS

Many times in looking over the past mistakes of
a man, we are apt to pre-judge him as to his future
usefulness. This is a human error and not to be
wholly condemned. Men in prison are aware of this
and the need to cloud this prejudicial error is preva-
lent in their minds. Many of them seek a wrong way
of over-riding these opinions. A great majority try
to change these cynical attitudes by creative, con-
structive deeds. They try to utilize their time in an
effort to seek a new way of life educationally and
emotionally. Such is the man we are profiling to-
day, in the person of Vincent Coladonato.

Vincent Coladonato was arrested in February of
1956. He entered the Eastern State Penitentiary in
October of that same year, to begin a five to fif-
teen year sentence. Itis important to point out that
he entered at the age of thirty-four. This statement
is stressed because many individuals at such a ma-
ture age find it pointless to change previous charac-
ter traits and ambitions. This man not only desired
to change but started on the road to a new construc-
tive way of life.

His institutional employment has been in the
printing plant. He has held this job for the length of
time served thus far. He began as a trainee-press-
man and advanced himself to the job of compositor.
This is a highly technical and important phase of the
printing industry. His behavior record has been
spotless and shows the willingness of this man.

I asked him this question: “What are your am-
bitions for the future?” His answer: “Though I
have a job opportunity waiting for me on release,
that is only secondary to my real ambition. I would
like to go into the restaurant business, with a partner
if necessary. I do not wish it to be large or elaborate
in setting, but something to provide myself and fam-
ily with the necessary essentials of life. A clean road
ahead and a decent way of living. I realize this is
not an easy venture and I am trying to prepare my-
self by taking advantage of the educational facilities
offered here.”

These words are true for he has taken and com-
pleted a Typing course, Good English and is now
nearing completion of a Cost Accounting Course.
The latter named is very important and necessary to
his type of future work ambition. These educational
endeavors have awakened him to the realization that
a little effort and incentive can make a life worth
living. The benefits to be derived are worth the
trivial exertion mentally.

He is a member of a large family and one thing
uppermost in his mind is a sister and all the family
concerned. He says, “I have an older sister who has
been like a mother to me. For many years she has
suffered many sorrows because of my errant ways in
the past. The gap is too large for me to try to span
all at once. I only hope I ¢an, in the future, prove to
her and the rest of the family that their loyalty and
faith in me have not been in vain. This time has been
a living example of the mistakes of the past. I can-
not rectify them entirely, but I hope to change the
adverse opinions by constructive deeds. —

He is attempting to improve his mental faculties
by participating as a member of the Chess Club here
at ESP. This is only one of his many struggles to
rise out of the depths of the criminal stigma and
emerge a new individual.

He has sought spiritual guidance since being
incarcerated and is instrumental in recruiting mem-
bers for the services.

This is the profile of a man who has reached the
turning point in life’s turbulent struggle. A man
who now realizes the value of freedom and the little
things in life which are taken for granted by so
many. A man who has not let time force him to re-
eress, but instead has served as an incentive to strive
for a better life. These words are entirely inade-
quate to deseribe the warm, human personality that
envelopes the total character of Vincent Coladonato.
