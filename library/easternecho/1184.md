Samewhere in the world I wish there were more
human beings who would realize that characters
grow and are capable of growing. I know of nothing
more discouraging to an individual than to have his
rehabilitation and growth completely discounted by
red ink marks on the debit side of the ledger, made
years ago.

The idea today that the man should be evalu-
ated in terms of a crime committed twenty years ago
makes a mockery of rehabilitation and of penology.
Frankly, I don't know how society expects to en-
courage rehabilitation if it doesn't give credit to
individuals who by dint of long, hard work and
careful thinking have rehabilitated themselves.

I think we should encourage it by giving a pat 
on the back to the guy who takes off his coat and
goes to work rehabilitating himself. If human be-
ings can't grow, if they can't change, if they can't
develop; and if hard, constructive work can't blot
out the mistakes of the past, then life is a mockery.

Erle Stanley Gardner
