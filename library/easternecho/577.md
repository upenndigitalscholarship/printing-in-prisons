ART SHOW

Members of the Pen Art Club, formed here nearly
two years ago, are pleased to announce that an ex-
hibit of their works is to be given at the Pyramid
Club, 1517 Girard Ave., Phila., during the month of
May. A minimum of sixty art pieces will be on view,
consisting of oils, water colors, and pastels. This will
be the club’s first showing in the city. They had pre-
viously exhibited at the Langhorn (Pa.) Library,
where much publicity had been received, and where
a few paintine’s had been sold. This is an excellent
indication of the progress being made under the
supervision of Mr. George Redling, prominent illus-
trator and fine artist, who has been conducting the
art classes here. The art class was also featured in a
magazine recently where the paintings drew much
favorable acclaim.
