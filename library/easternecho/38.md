INDIVIDUAL THERAPY. REBUTTAL

by STERLING B. JAMES

After reading an article appearing in March issue
of EASTERN ECHO under the title ‘‘ Individual
Therapy’’, I conducted an unobtrusive investigation
among the seldom consulted ‘‘John Q. Population’’
to determine what extent the views discussed corre-
spond with the average guy’s thinking. I dis-
covered that Therapy, its purposes and aims, meant
little or nothing to the majority questioned. The
single ‘‘chary’’ person encountered, was a lad of
good intelligence who expressed a desire to ‘‘gas’’
with one of the psychologists about a subject, oddly
enough, having to do with HYPNOTISM! On a
less significant level, I found the atmosphere clean-
sed of every vestige of intelligence regarding such
terms as ‘‘psychotherapy’’, ‘‘post-operative”, etc.,
as most of those queried couldn’t recall ever having
heard the terms used in connection with Therapy, if,
indeed, they had heard the terms used at all. Re-
marking the disparity between what I read and
what I saw, I concluded my brief inquiry.

The study proved illuminating. I discovered a
trend in attitudes as normal as any to be found in
society if a comparable survey should be made—
that in the ordinary course of living, people, gener-
ally, do not feel a need for personality treatment.
To the average ‘‘Joe’’ in prison (or in society), the
ceaseless, omnipresent ‘‘pull’’ of just plain living
engages him too completely to allow time for emo-
tion-consultations. He will confess to having a
‘“bad head’’ if cornered. This said, however, he is
most likely to make one of the fastest transitions
you will ever witness as he transfers to the really
important and puzzling business of the moment—
especially if it happens to be a Thursday night—
‘‘How’m I gonna score for an extra shot of coffee’’!
There’s no point to deceive oneself. Unless a man
is really conscious of some continuing emotional
harassment within himself, he will feel no com-
pulsion to therapy. But is there anything more
ridiculous or futile than an attempt to convince a
man who has a material or ‘‘outward’’ problem,
but who lives in reasonable peace with himself
otherwise, that he is emotionally unbalanced? ‘To
what qualities in him does one apply? Isolate his
problem! Give him a coupla grand!

The meaning of ‘‘emotional stability’’ has little
meaning to me anyway. Except in a few eases of
very old persons, I have seen no really emotionally
stable humans in my lifetime. The very stamp of
emotion is a certain ‘‘stirring’’ quality. The little
phrase as it is set forth in the article, however, is
lost to me completely. There seems to be the im-
plication that the side of the law which a man
occupies determines his emotional posture.

Therapy should stand above the level of crimi-
nality as there is the danger of establishing an
unnatural connection between a problem that might
be wholly material or extraneous and one that might
be strictly emotional. It certainly would seem pru-
dent to stand a safe distance from the obvious allure-
ments and preoccupations of a man’s crime so that
the true nature of his internal problem (if there is
one) can be seen with penetrating and unwavering
clarity. As it goes, the idea behind I.T. does not
show in sharp relief that respect in which lawless
and lawful men do in fact differ. I take my cue
from such short-sighted thinking, and must regard
therapy as but a featureless appendage to E.S.P’s
Treatment Branch.

Excluding the factor of some definite mental
disease, I do not think therapy serves any signi-
ficant purpose for the average person. I for one
find it hard to persuade myself that the path to
maturation can be abridged except through the
natural process of experiencing life. When we are
young, there is darkness and confusion and gross
exaggerations. We do not know ourselves, we can-
not know ourselves, we burn with too many exciting,
urgent desires. ‘‘Life’s wine is too heady’’. We
are young and proud and stupid—no sooner we
don one role, we instantly change it for another.
For some of us there are ‘‘tangents’’ and ‘‘blind
alleys’’ but this is all part of the growing. We
are possessed with boundless energies to be either
constructively channeled or dissipated into some
socially unacceptable outlay, depending in some
measure upon the environmental advantages and op-
portunities available. I think, though, that only
after certain physiological changes begin to take
place within our bodies and our ‘‘blood begins to
flow less hotly’’ can we strike any appreciable
equipoise between the conflicting elements of our
soul. Meanwhile we can do little more than to
educate ourselves, enlighten ourselves by reading
and studying what the best minds have written
about the troubled soul and the human predicament ;
by listening to the true and unaffected sounds of
life around us; by observing the conduct of both
ourselves and others. But above all, if we have
sought crime as a solution to our material problems,
and found that we have been duped through ac-
quisition, ignorance, laziness or lack of ability, we
must not indulge ourselves further, we must, as a
matter of life and death almost, exercise moderation
in all things. We must also learn some practical
skill which will enable us to earn our bread within
the social frame-work. The great thing, however,
is to KNOW—to REALLY KNOW, that the only
life worth living for the human animal is among
society. . . free society.

Poverty, bad education, inadequate recreational
outlets for the young are some of the principal
causes of crime. This is a commentary not so much
on the emotional condition of men as on the de-
fective state of a society which, even at its worst,
seeks to better itself. Obviously, then, if the prob-
lem is tackled in prisons as in society, from the
standpoint of realism, it is best handled by the
educational and vocational branches of prison ad-
ministration ... of course with infinitely more bold-
ness and imagination than what has been evidenced
hitherto. Intelligence and practical abilities are
what is most needed. These things can be fostered
by known methods of education.
