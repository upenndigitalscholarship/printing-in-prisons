No obligation to justice does force a man to be cruel, or to use the
sharpest sentence. A just man does justice to every man and to every-
thing; and then, if he be also wise, he knows there is a debt of mercy
and compassion due to the infirmities of man’s nature; and that is to be
paid; and he that is cruel and ungentle to a sinning person, and does
the worst to him, is in his debt and is unjust.

—JEREMY TAYLOR
