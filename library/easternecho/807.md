"The Greeks studied man and the laws of life as they found them. And
they realized profoundly, as we have forgotton—to the negation of life—that
virtue consists not in denying the nature of man, but in so developing all ele-
ments of it into such an efficient, beautiful and harmonious whole that of his
life each (man) creates a work of art.”

Joseph Gavorse’s introduction to
The Works of Thucydides
