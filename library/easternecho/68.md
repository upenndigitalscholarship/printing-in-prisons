I HAVE JUST FINISHED READING Charles
Dickens’ ‘‘American Notes’’, dealing with his
visit to the Eastern State Penitentiary.

This visit was made in March, 1842, the day
after he had his pockets picked by a three-fingered
gentleman of the free city of Brotherly Love. I be-
lieve this unfortunate contact with this unscrupu-
lous character had no bearing on his criticism of the
prison system employed in Pennsylvania.

His writing, so much in demand in England,
created a wave of sympathy causing the formation
of a Dickens Society who for 100 years sent hand
painted Christmas cards versed in English and
foreign languages for distribution to all inmates.

At the time of Dickens’ attacks on the Pennsyl-
vania system as it was known then, there were many
ardent exponents that this system represented the
best minds of Penology. It was copied by other
states and foreign countries and proved workable
and successful. Richard Vaux, an inspector of this
institution from 1842 to 1895, was a strong defender
of the Pennsylvania System.

Numerous changes have been made since those
times, and in fact, in the last three years many pro-
gressive and forward steps in penal management
have been made. Beforehand, the system was lack-
ing and each jail or prison was no better than its
head. There was no set policy of operation, no one
to appeal to for guidance or assistance in the many
problems that confront a Warden. The Warden
has been relieved of many of his previous complex
duties, they being delegated to Clinics where the
judgment of the group is superior to the judgment
of one.

Industry, the most valuable asset to the re-
habilitation of the incarcerated, is being encouraged.

This forward progress has been made possible
by a program of operation formulated in conjunction
with the Department of Justice by Arthur T.
Prasse, Commissioner of Correction. His enthusiasm
in doing a good job is without a parallel. When a
Warden has a problem on food or preparation,
parole forms or system of keeping records, engineer-
ing or construction, farm management, budget or
personnel, Mr. Prasse has an expert trouble shooter
on his way and at your service. This service
contributes to better management and complete
understanding affecting the lives of inmates. Many
innovations, with the expectation that you, the in-
mates, will be benefited and be better suited for
useful citizenship, are being introduced.

I have learned through the grapevine that the
‘‘Eastern Echo’’ is to make its debut this first
quarter of the year 1956. In my thirty-three years
of state penal service I have seen several Monthlies
and Quarterlies. To be part of ‘‘EKastern Echo”’
and a contributor of this article to its first issue is
a privilege. .

I salute you and sincerely hope you serve a
useful purpose and be an asset to your fellow man.

Frank G. Martin, Warden
