‘‘The Greeks studied man and the laws of life as they found them. And they realized
profoundly, as we have forgotten—to the negation of life—that virtue consists not in
denying the nature of man, but in so developing all elements of it into such an efficient,
beautiful and harmonious whole that of his life each (man) creates a work of art.’’

—Joseph Gavorse’s introduction to
The Works of Thucydides
