SOME PROGRESS

When his attempt to rob a Detroit Bank was thwarted, an 33-year-old man, who
admittedly had spent 69 years of his life behind bars, was held for investigation of
robbery. His possessions at the time of arrest included a pair of broken eye glasses,
a pocket knife, safety razor and three razor blades.

“Is this all you've got to show for 83 years?” police asked.

“I've made progress,” he replied. “When I was young they didn’t have safety
razors."
