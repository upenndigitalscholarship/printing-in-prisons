CHESS ACTIVITY
by FRANK FERRERA

SECOND CLASS TOURNAMENT

Starting on April 12, and continuing through
May 12, our Chess players matched wits with one
another in each of the 4 classes.

The top men in each class were: A-Thomas
Brawner, B-William Mosley, C-Robert Harris, and
D-William Diggs.

CHESS SCHOOL UNDERWAY

Convincing most participants who entered the
tournaments that they had settled to their perspec-
tive playing level, we, as a group, decided upon a
program which furnished excellent instruction to all
those interested in the most progressive brain game
ever conceived.

The more experienced and better informed mem-
bers of the group volunteered their combined ser-
vices to produce wonderful results.

The system in use is the teaching of the end-
game principles, which has been established beyond
doubt as the best method.

To those who are unfamiliar with this method,
a brief explanation will be made.

In Chess, there are 32 units (pieces) present
on the magic 64 square board. Now after a few
moves, technically called openings, the possible
moves that can be made pyramid to staggering
proportions. As the game progresses into the end-
game (technically when the opposing queens have
been exchanged) and finally down to a few pieces
on each side, the best moves are reduced to a mini-
mum. In fact there is usually only one good move.
Hence, principles can be shown easily and one can
learn the best use for each particular piece.

It follows that when one learns the end-game,
he will know how to conduct his play in the middle
game. He will know when to exchange pieces, oc-
cupy vital posts, control open files and where to
blockade, and since space prevents a complete list
of Chess objectives, we allow the reader to realize
the rest.

Through such instruction, one knows when to
make favorable exchanges, how to make vital pawn
moves, and by so doing, he will ultimately reach a
favorable end-game position and be able to exploit
his opponent’s weaknesses.

To sum up, one cannot expect a player to ealeu-
late his moves easily with 32 pieces on the board, if
he is unable to successfully maneuver 4 or 5 pieces.

Through personal knowledge, I know that there
are a lot of Chess players in this instiution who do
not belong to our little Chess Group. I appeal to
these men, and also to anyone who is interested in
learning the game, to join our little organization.
Everyone is welcome. Who knows? You may
have hidden Chess talents.

SECOND CHESS MEETING WITH TEMPLE

On May 21, the second match took place with
Temple. Five players were matched together from
the opposing teams, and as the smoke cleared, three
Easterners stumbled, one stayed on his feet, and
William Hallowell scored our side’s lone win.

John Stevens at Board #1 for Temple, mane-
uvering his Queen adroitly in a King’s Indian De-
fence, scored an overwhelming material advantage
and forced Thomas Brawner to resign like a gentle-
man in 23 moves.

Harold Kuppersmit, also a Templite, wrung a
49 move resignation from William Mosley in a
King’s Fianchetto Defence on Board #2.

William Hallowell at Board #3 never let up on
Howard Bell in a Queen’s Gambit Declined, and
with a series of strong moves, sacrificed a Bishop
for a forced win. The sacrifice was declined how-
ever, but two deft checks won the Queen and the
opposition threw in the towel. This was the East-
ernites only win.

Henry Lackner, playing the white pieces on
Board #4 for temple, won over Michael Quinn.
Thirty-five moves were required in a cleverly fought
contest revolving around a French Defence.

William Ginsberg, at Board #5 for Temple,
chose a Sicilian Defence against our Martin Pearson
and held his own for 38 well calculated moves. Both
players agreed to call the game a draw.

Final score: Temple 34 points to 14 for East-
ern.

We are looking forward to more outside
matches, and we have Mr. Ray Whittaker, Director
of Student Publications at Temple, to thank for
his aid in arranging these matches.
