Rabbi Victor Solomon

Jewish Chaplain

The Hebrew word
for “‘echo’’ is Batiz
Kol. Significantly
Bath Kol also refers
to a ‘Divine Voice.’
After reading sev-
eral issues of the
ECHO, I was im-
pressed with the
same relationship of
the words. THE ECHO is indeed an inspired and
inspiring voice. It speaks from the heart and ad-
dresses itself directly to the heart. For this: reason
I would lke to avail myself of this opportunity to
thank the editors and staff of ECHO for they, too,
are co-workers, with us, in the vineyard of the Lord.

The power of the written word should not be under-
estimated. It can move mountains as well as souls,
probe depths of mind and conscience. Coming from
pens placed in proper hands it becomes an irresistible
force for good. May your hands be strengthened and
your ECHO resound in the corridors of rebuilt lives.

ED. In the near future we hope to be able to furnish
a report on the new synagogue, which was recently
completed.
