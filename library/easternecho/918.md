The 1963 Softball season came to a
close with the Mustangs, winners of the
first half and the Falcons, winners of
the second half, squaring off in the
playoffs. It was the best out of five
games, with the Falcons pulling the
last two out to win the series and the
championship for the second straight
year. The enthusiasm of previous years
was missing in the playoffs this year.
Due to circumstances beyond our con-
trol many of the players that started
the season were sent to other institu-
tions and there were numerous changes
in team personnel that affected the
whole league.

It would be impossible to put the
team rosters in this issue because of
these many changes. I do want to ex-
tend my congratulations to the Falcons
on winning the Championship, and,
also, to the Mustangs for putting up a
game fight in the playoffs, because
right in the middle of the games the
Mustangs lost their best pitcher, George
Kalvitis. Rock took over and did a
tremendous job, both pitching and in
the hitting department, but “No No”
was too much for the Mustangs. We
hope that things will be different next
year. We are all looking forward to a
much better season in 1964.
