ALL-STARS BEAT OUTSIDE TWICE

Mr. Thompson leads the All-Stars to two wins in as many
games. Under the coaching of Mr. Thompson we finally got a
much needed victory plus the elation we all received in beating
Mr. Doyle’s team, a feat we have never before accomplished.
You should have seen Shakey.

Holley was the big factor in scoring and ball handling.
Fricker, Woody, O’Brien, Donnie, Shakey, Barnes, Big Jim,
Bogardus, Herb, Juice, Shep, and A.A. Joe are quite a bit of
talent. Keep up the good work Mr. Thompson.
