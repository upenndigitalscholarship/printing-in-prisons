We Know Why

I wonder what the Shepherds thought,
That night in Bethlehem;
I wonder did they realize,
The world would hear of them.

I wonder of the Wise Men,
With their frankincense and myrrh;
Too, of the Virgin Mary,
And the words they spoke to Her.

I wonder of the keeper,
Who owned the crowded Inn;
I know he didn’t realize,
This Babe would bear his sin.

How lucky people are today,
For we have learned his worth;
And we have no cause to wonder,
Why Christ came down to earth.

Of All The Days

Of all the days throughout the year,
The best is Christmas day;
When merry carols fill the air,
And hearts are light and gay.

When little boys and little girls,
Are on their best behaviour;
And peace on earth fills every mind,
On this birthday of our saviour.

The ringing of the chapel bells,
The windows in bright display.
I think the summit of My Joy,
Is reached this happy day.

This is the day when people share,
A lot of joy and laughter;
If every day were Christmas,
There’d be peace here, ever-after.
