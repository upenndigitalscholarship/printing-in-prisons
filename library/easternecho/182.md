‘‘There are four sorts of men:
He who knows not and knows not he knows not:
he is a fool—shun him;
He who knows not and knows he knows not:
he is simple—teach him.
He who knows and knows not he knows :
he is asleep—wake him. — :
He who knows and knows he knows:
he is wise—follow him.’

From ‘‘Life of Sir Richard Burton’’ by Lady Burton
