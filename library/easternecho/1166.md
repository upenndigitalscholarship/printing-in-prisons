THE BRAVES
Jay Kay

The Braves have plenty of spirit, and hustle, but
it is doubtful that this alone will help them overtake the
rest of the league in the pennant drive. ‘Shorty’ Jordan,
manager and only pitcher, is, nevertheless, optimistic. His
team members are Johnny Williams, “Big A’’ Archey, John
Grandy, William Mitchell, Melvin ‘Piggy’ Brown, Wade
Tucker, Orie Paschall, Herbert Elliott, Henry Knox, Loyd
Black, George Jamitowski and Charlie Whiting.

Any accurate description of the team would have to
include the observation that these guys enjoy playing the
game, and with a break here and there or a player or
two more with genuine game savvy they could surprise a
lot of people.

OWNER and MGR. Fred Jordan
