"On the other hand, if the society can be sufficiently objective and understanding in
not having to burn psychoties as witches or punish offenders as criminals; if the society
can express its aggressions through football, boxing, politics, and TV stories; then the

we are aware."

From ‘‘Blueprint for the Progressive Prison’’ by Vernon Fox, Ph. D.,
in the June-1956 Issue of FEDERAL PROBATION.
