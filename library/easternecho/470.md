Good and evil we know in
this field of the world grew
up inseparably; and the know-
ledge of good is so involved
and interwoven with the know-
ledge of evil, and in so many
cunning resemblances hardly to
be discerned . . . . . . therefore,
the knowledge and survey of
vice is in this world so ne-
cessary to the constituting of hu-
man virtue, and the Scanning
of error to the confirmation of
truth, how can we more safe-
ly, and with less danger, scout
into the regions of sin and fal-
sity than by reading all man-
ner of tracts and hearing all
manner of reason?

â€” JOHN MILTON
