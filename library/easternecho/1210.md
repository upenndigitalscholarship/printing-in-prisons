NEVER BECOME TOO LONELY

Lost in the wilds of Africa for two years,
A professor of English wept lonely tears.
“Oh to talk to someone,’’ he said to the breeze,
"All I have about me are animals and trees.’’

One day—he caught a careless tiger in a trap.
To the professor, Mr. Tiger looked an intelligent chap.
And he was, for English, the tiger did very soon grasp.
Causing the professor to leave open the cage’s hasp.

That evening—out strolled Mr. Tiger saying, ‘‘It is
food I desire!’’
"Certainly," said the learned one, ‘‘come sit by the
fire."

As the professor set the table on a lightning-cut
stump . . .

“Pardon Sir,’’ interrupted the tiger, “‘I’ll just gnaw
on your rump.’’
