You Think It’s Easy?

Publishing this magazine is no picnic.

If we print jokes, people think we are silly;

If we don’t, they say we are too serious.

If we don’t accept contributions, we don’t appreciate
true genius.

If we do print “The Echo” it’s filled with junk!

If we clip things from other magazines, we're too lazy
to write them;

If we don’t, we are stuck with our own horrible stuff.

If we edit the other fellow’s stuff, we're too critical;

If we don’t, we're asleep.

Now some character will probably say | swiped this from
some other publication. — I DID.

The Editor
