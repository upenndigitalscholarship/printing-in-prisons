RIDE THE WAVE'S CREST

Time will never cease its remorseless
forward momentum. Like an onrushing
flood it will carry us with it. Hopes of
turning back the overwhelming flood will
be in vain.

Since we can do nothing about it, why
not ride along? It will take less exertion
on your part and may turn out to be a fine
ride. Who knows?

But as the wave surges forward, try to
ride the crest for only from that point will
you be able to gaze fully on the surround-
ing vista. You may find something you’ll
like to carry along with you.

In passing through life we pick up
many things. Let’s try and pick up those
things that will benefit us.

If we are sincere in what we are do-
ing we should acquire an edueation, a trade
to fall back on and as many friends as pos-
sible.

All these things may be acquired by
sincere actions in your everyday life. G.H.
