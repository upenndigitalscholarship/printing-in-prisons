LOVER'S LEAP
by Samuel Snyder

You've said that our love is over
And, dear, it makes me weep
As I stand here so all alone
On top of lover's leap

The valley's far below me
Down the mountain, oh, so steep
But I will soon be down there, dear
When I jump from lover's leap

There’s nothing left to live for
I just can’t face another dawn
The world for me has ended
Now that I know you’re gone

Good bye; good luck; God bless you
I‘m going to my sleep
You'll find this letter waiting
On top of lover's leap
