Penal Press Reviews
by HAROLD LEE WARREN

PRESIDIO (Iowa) Visually very attractive, but such
an execessive accent on gloom, especially for the
Thanksgiving-Christmas issue, makes it hard to take.
I think everyone in prison knows that Christmas and
jail can never be synonymous, which, in itself, is a
good reason for not wanting to read such morbid ar-
ticles as DOOMED, ESCAPE TO LIMBO or TO-
MORROW’S PUBLIC ENEMIES. In another bleak
article, TEEN-AGE DIARY, wouldn’t two boys have
made a better comparison than a nice girl and a
delinquent boy?—It may be that you are over-
worked, Bob (Goddard, Editor), since your name
appears on almost as many articles as all other con-
tributors combined, but, in any case, January’s issue
continued along the same depressing pattern. With
such titles as READ’N, WRIT’N, AND RUBBER
HOSES and ORGANIZED CHAOS, you are accentu-
ating the negative.

*

BULLETIN (Alabama) Anyone who puts out as
neat a magazine with only mimeograph deserves it,
so here’s hoping you get your wish for 1959: A
printing press and a “slick” magazine.

*

INSIDER (District of Columbia) Your regular
features, covering music, book reviews, sports, etc.
are interesting and well-written, but your covers
need a further dash of imagination.

*

AGENDA (Washington) Your wide use of photos
gives a wonderful inside picture of your institution
and activities. How do you rate an air-conditioned
dining room? Wow! O.C. Wiles, keep up the good
“eomments”—You are one of the few writers who
ean deliver a laugh and a message in one line.

*

ENCOURAGER (Indiana) Ted Hume and the art
class deserve praise a plenty for a cover that would
look good on any wall. Autumn’s wild colors were
perfectly captured in a sheerly beautiful cover—
made more so by the fact that not a word was printed
on it.

*

RECOUNT (Colorado) Your fall number was chock
full of interest right up to the last page’s intriguing
invitation “Drop In Anytime’, one which we respect-
fully decline. Here’s hoping John Smalley’s “Never,
Never!” rules of bridge will be obeyed to the letter.
We would sure abide by them here .. . if we had
cards.

*

COURIER (Maryland) Joe Hollifield, an editor
with a sense of humor, and staff: Congratulations on
accomplishing with mimeo what many others have
failed to accomplish with printing presses: an easy-
to-read, full-of-interest magazine.

*

FORUM (Nebraska) Your special “subject of the
month” idea is very god. The food issue was espe-
cially interesting and unique. You guys should be
well-fed. All this and stuffed celery, too!

*

AGRICOLA (Ohio) Very nice, well organized
monthly, and your covers are clever. The December
one was very appealing, for it told an appropriate
story in itself.

*

ENCHANTED NEWS (New Mexico) Your silk
screening is really lush . . . catches the eye like a
goldfish bowl. Danny Curran, thanks for providing
the laugh of the month with your unintentional
“comedy of errors.” Let’s see if ve got it straight.
The MONOCLE commented that the BUENA VISTA
REVIEW made too many mistakes. In doing this,
they made an error by misspelling “typographical”
—then, in your pointing out their mistake, you erred
by omitting a question mark to “Need we-say more.”
Gets confusing after awhile, doesn’t it? But you had
the right idea, anyway. What one says is still more
important than how one says it. And there are er-
rors in the slickest of publications, because, while
they have created the perfect machine, they have yet
to create the perfect human.

*

BORDER-SENTINEL (Texas) Had great difficul-
ty reading this one, till someone came along and
gave me the combination: “Go to page 3, turn up-
side-down ... on to page 11, turn back to right side
up, but start from the back and go toward front. .
.’ It is obvious that you go to a lot of trouble to put
out a worthwhile magazine, so why would the very
last operation be so hap-hazard? No comprendo the
shuffled, upside-down pages, Senor.

*

SPOKESMAN (Georgia) <A neat, comprehensive
little journal. Very much liked your “Belles of
Time” and mainly because of the lack of perfect
erammar, which made it read like just exactly what
it was supposed to be: a chat. Proof positive that
perfection can sometimes be dull.

*
KEYSTONE (Pennsylvania) Et tu, Brute.

THE END
