EVOLUTION

Whither? How? Whence?
Cometh racing thru my brain,
Placing former hours of moodiness
slumbering softly in their vein.

For here in contemplation
of silent Where? now and then,
Rises moments of anxiety
and remembrance of places we have been.

Tho’ our association is quite new
desire deems it so very old,
The future is our fortune-teller
as a sharing exchange doth unfold.

The isms, the odes, and poetic works
standing foremost in thoughts to blend,
The acceptance of a fondling one
surely the potential of a friend.

Our past is done tho’ it remains
like strewn sand upon a shore,
But within their vivid imprint
lies material for our new score.

Shall it be writing, philosophy or other
like history or happenings of today,
Let's make it musical, and dramatic
or use art to pant our way.

Whatever we decide upon
well set our sights above,
Then surely we shall soar thru all
as gently as winged dove.

Our parting is sure and this we know
but distance is no insurmountable fence,
All paths are twain and this is sure
study—Whither? How? And Whence?

—Leonard Bowie
