CRIMINAL LAW

There'll be a change in our legal code if the efforts of a law professor and a
noted whodunit author are successful. The two men are Professor B. James George,
Jr., of the University of Michigan law school, and mystery writer Erle Stanley Gardner.
Although they are not actually working together, they are working toward the same
end. Along with other criminal law experts, they are urging that a legal procedure
be set up for appealing the length of criminal sentences and also imposition of the
death penalty.

The law now permits a convicted person to appeal his conviction. As Professor
George points out, one can request an appeal court to review a case, and if enough
mistakes are found on the part of the trial judge, a new trial may be ordered. But there
is no relative procedure for appealing the JUSTNESS OF A SENTENCE.

“The U.S.“ he notes, “is the only country in the world with a highly developed
legal sysem that leaves sentencing entirely in the hands of one judge. Moreover, these
sentences are not ordinarily subject to review.” Professor George has brought this
“deficiency’’ to the attention of more than 100 Federal judges.

Author Gardner, a successful lawyer before he became a best-selling mystery
story writer, is backing up the professor's efforts. He has formed an unofficial “Court
of Last Resort’’ to help prisoners unjustly convicted of crimes. He is also campaigning
for judicial review of prison sentences. This would mean more than one way out of a
death sentence, which now depends on the clemency of a state’s governor.

Professor George made a survey of criminal courts in foreign countries and found
that “sentences usually are imposed only by majority vote of three or more judges and
reasons for the sentences imposed must be given.” France, Germany and Italy provide
for review of sentences by a complete rehearing of the case. In Great Britain, the
defendant may appeal against a sentence, after which it may be raised, lowered, or stay
the same. India and Pakistan allow either the injured party or the state to appeal a
sentence as being too lenient. However, the Michigan law professor believes that an
appeal by the prosecution would be prohibited in this country by the protection against
double jeopardy (being prosecuted twice for the same offense).

Professor George also found that other nations usually impose lighter penalties
than the U.S. for similar crimes, and that their legal codes contain a means for increas-
ing and decreasing sentences. “With this in mind,” he says, “we might well review the
minimum penalties provided by the law to see if they should be lowered or made
more flexible.” One encouraging factor, according to the professor, is that more
indeterminate sentences are now being imposed, which is leading to a more prominent
role for the parole board in determining a prisoner’s ultimate sentence.
