Caught In Passing

Opening night at one New York Jazz club
was made uncomfortable by heat and nearly
solid smoke. The manager left in seach of ex-
planation and returned to say “One of the blow-
ers just went out” just in time to catch the ear
of a wandering hippie.

“I know man,” he said “But he told me he’d
be back before the next set.”
