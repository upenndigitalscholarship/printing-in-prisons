The Ten Commandments of Prison

1. Thou shalt respect the rights of thy fellow pris-
oner, giving unto him the same consideration which
thou desirest for thyself.

2. Honor the rules and regulations, lest thy time be
prolonged in this land to which the judge has sent
thee.

3. Thou shalt mind thy own business, lest thy pro-
boscis (nose) be scarred by the blows of thy fellow-
man.

4. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbor, lest thou be branded all the days that thou
dwellest here.

5. Thou shalt not steal thy neighbor's weed, nor
his pipe, nor his blankets, lest thou awaken some
night and find thyself stripped of thy dearest posses-
sions.

6. Thou shalt not “BUM RAP,” lest thy fellow in-
mates shun thee like the plague.

7. Do the work which is allotted thee, lest thou find
thyself among the humble toilers of the BRICKPILE
gang.

8. Incur not the wrath of thy superiors, lest thou be
cast into the darkness of the hole.

9. Honor these commandments and refuse them
not, lest thou suffer great disappointment on the day
thou meetest the Parole Board.

10. Thou shalt. . .  .  or else.

From the Reflector, Pendleton Ind.
