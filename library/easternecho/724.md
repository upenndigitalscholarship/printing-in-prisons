The distaff side ...

American men do not want the world to be half free and half female.
The patience and intuition of women are obviously good for more than dishes
and diapers. In 1890, the average woman lived 14 years after her last child
had turned 21; in 1961, between earlier marriage and longer life, the same
period spans 30 years. How this 30 year span is spent could well exert in-
fluences more profound and far reaching than the present generation may
conceive.

In the heyday of U.S. feminism an indomitable suffragette gave a dis-
couraged follower some militant advice. “Call on God, my dear. She will
help you.” But the Deity ignores wrongly addressed prayers, and He has
kept to the old system, under which women bear babies and men pretty much
run everything. No woman has yet been elected president, and, as critic Diana
Trilling once remarked. "It is even hard to imagine a play called, ‘Death of
a Saleswoman." However, to their credit, women are still at sea and their
rule is, men and children first.

The overall influence, for better or worse, of the gentler sex whether from
the cradle or the grave over men who are imprisoned far’ excells that of any
other influence touching on the existence of these men. And so it will ever be.
