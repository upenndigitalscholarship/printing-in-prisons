From
the
Superintendent's Desk

In recent months the institution lost two good friends. Dr. Nathan Blumberg,
our Medical Director, passed away and our loss cannot be measured. Dr. Blumberg
was a friend to all. He always had time to listen to a man’s complaints about his
physical condition. He never belittled an individual who came into his office. Few
of us know what the good doctor went through during the last years of his life, but
he never allowed his own illness to interfere with his dedicated life to our population.

Pete Byron, for many years, acted as Master of Ceremonies at our athletic
banquet. While not an employee of the institution he was ever ready to lend a helping
hand. Along with his regular work, Pete was also the “Voice of the Phillies” at all
home games at Connie Mack Stadium. Even with this busy schedule Pete took of his
time to spend a happy evening with us and to enlist other sport celebreties to entertain
us. We missed him at the banquet this year but his spirit was with us.

Would that there were more like Dr. Blumberg and Pete Byron. Wherever you
are, the prayers of hundreds of us are with you.

A. T. Rundle
