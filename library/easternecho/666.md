Our Cover illustration is taken from a collection of Honore Daumier lithographs,
entitled, “Les Gens De Justice.” Depicting a solicitor and his client, it bears the
caption:

Thief—” Just between us, | was the one that stole the watch. You won’t abandon my
case because |’m guilty, will you?”

Lawyer—” My dear thief you don’t know my heart well. You must not have had much
contact with lawyers. Now that | am certain you did the job, I'll use the
alibi, cause I know where you were at during the crime.”
(Rough translation)

....Like the greater majority of Daumiers work, it was satire intended to expose to
public gaze the mercenary and cunning barristers, suffering defendants, and
apathetic judges of his age.
