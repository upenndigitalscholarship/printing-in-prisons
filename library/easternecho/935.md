AIN’T YOU GOT NO MAGAZINES?

You got anything at all to read,
something to kill this time I don’t need?
Give me something so my time don’t drag,
a new Reader's Digest or last month’s Stag.
There’s nothin’ to read but a bunch of books;
what about those Jets and that stack of old Looks?
I can make it till bedtime with a Cavalier. . .
Man! send me them damn magazines down here.
I dug the ball game and the weather and news
and I spent two hours shinin’ my shoes. . .
Send me somethin’! Boy, this ole cell’s dead;
if a guy just sits he'll go out of his head.
Hey! I’ll trade ya this Life for those Silyer Screens. . .

WHAT?

Poetry - Say, man! Ain’t you got no magazines?
