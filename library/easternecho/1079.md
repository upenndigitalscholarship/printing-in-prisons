NEW SPORTS EDITOR FOR ECHO

Commencing with the Winter Issue 1965, the ECHO
will have a new sports editor. John J. Klauzenberg
will replace Ed Scoleri, “who resigned, to give some-
one else a chance.”

Klauzenberg will also write ‘Inside Information." 
formerly written by Don Coll (Frank “Irish’’ Murphy)
We welcome John to the ECHO staff and extend to him
every good wish for success.
