Detainers and Vou

Editor's Note: Many wnmates have asked for wfor-
mation regarding the ‘‘Detainer Law.’’ “ECHO now
prints the law as it was passed last year.

COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA:
House Bill 1381, Session of 1957.

An Act: Providing for the mandatory disposi-
tion of detainers lodged against persons imprisoned
in any state, county, or municipal penal or correction-
al institution, effective July 1, 1957.

The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:

SEC.1 Whenever any person has entered upon any
term of imprisonment in the institutions named above
of this Commonwealth, and whenever during the con-
tinuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending
in this Commonwealth any untried indictment against
any such prisoner he shall be brought to trial within
one hundred and eighty (180) days... The written
notice and request for final disposition referred to
in paragraph (a) hereof shall be sent by the prisoner
to the warden, superintendent, commissioner of cor-
rection or other official having custody of him, who
shall promptly forward it (together with the certifi-
eate) to the appropriate DA and the court by
registered mail, or certified mail, return receipt
requested.

SEC. 2. In the event that the action is not brought
to trial within the period of time as herein provided
no court of this state shall any longer have juris-
diction thereof nor shall the untried indictment be
of any further force or effect, and the court shall
enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.

In our next edition the Hditor will discuss
“THE DETAINER WARRANT” and what it means
to you.
