An Editorial

Most Pennsylvanians have one simple solution for all the problems of crime—catch
the crook, lock him in a cell and then throw the key away. This observation leads one
to think the above is true only as far as the layman is concerned. However, it can as
easily be applied to the courts themselves.

I have seldom met a person that didn’t know how to solve these problems. They
have one formula—long punishment. You, society, have seldom met such a person.
Neither have any of the many men and women in prison, who currently are serving long
sentences handed down by the same judges who have stated that “we are well aware of
the inequities of the current sentencing procedures.”

We must admit there are cases, but “only a few,’ in which severe sentences are
the best or only solution. I hold that rehabilitation through probation and parole is the
most effective way to handle crime. Yes, severe sentences are sometimes the best or
only solution. However, there are many cases in which severe sentences were not the
solution; in which a severe sentence made a bitter, vindictive criminal out of an
offender.

When | state “only a few,” I mean cases deserving of long punishment are few;
not cases in which long sentences are meted out merely because the court has consist-
ently and frequently doled out harsh punishment since its inception ,and has continued
to do so.

Society must go along in reference to rehabilitation through probation and parole
as being the most effective manner in handling crime; but probation and especially pa-
role, is a rare occurrence these days.

Recently we came up with some startling statistics. These showed that the aver-
age parole officer handles 69 cases; a load so heavy that the existing force cannot ade-
quately supervise every person currently on probation and parole.

Diagnosis of the specific individual situation and then rehabilitation through build-
ing up the confidence of the person in the community and in himself in the most effec-
tive way to solve problems once the crime has been committed.

Society should urge the highest standards and qualifications for those in probation
and parole work. The present system is not producing the results it could, apparently.
Evidently what is needed is a corps of able and efficient personnel, that will be able to
command the respect and admiration of the ex-con; whereby their advice and counsel-
ing will be eagerly sought after. Then the offender will come to them and not them
running after the offender.
