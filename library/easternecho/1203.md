TESTING — FOUR WORDS

This is God speaking!

Russians looked around in surprise —
Afrikaners shot themselves —
Chinese paused attentively —
Americans did these things and more —
They phoned the weatherman.

(Castro unplugged the most powerful
loud-speaker in the world.)

Wallander

SCATTERED SEEDS

Bought a toy
For my little boy
Gee, did I have fun!
Children go bang bang
To kill with such glee
I never thought
One day he’d kill me.

Norman Pearson
