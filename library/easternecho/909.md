The Monkey's Viewpoint

Three Monkeys sat in a coconut tree
Discussing things as they are said to be
Said one to the others. “Now listen you two,
There’s a certain rumor that can’t be true.
That man descended from our noble race
The very idea! It’s a dire disgrace,
No Monkey ever deserted his wife,
Starved her baby and ruined her life.
And you ve never known a Mother Monk,
To leave her baby with others to bunk
Or pass them from one to another
Till they hardly know who is their mother
And another thing! You will never see
A monk build a fence ’round his coconut tree
And let the coconuts go to waste,
Forbidding all other monks a taste.
Why if I put a fence around this tree
Starvation would force you to steal from me.
Here’s another thing a monk won't do,
Go out at night and get on a stew,
Or use a gun or club or knife.
To take some other Monkey’s life.
Yes! Man descended, the onery cuss,
But BROTHER, he didn’t descend from us.”
