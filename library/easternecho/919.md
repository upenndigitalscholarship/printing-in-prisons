MEXICAN LEAGUE SOFTBALL

The Mets were too much for this
league. They won both halves, there-
fore, there was no need for a playoff.
They were undefeated the first half and
won 25 of their games in the second
half, for a season total of 55 wins and 5
Losses. The Mets were a well balanced
team and they had the best pitching in
the league. Johnny Downs won 34
while losing only 1, and George Mike-
tish won 21 and lost 4. They also led
the league in hitting, with Dawkins
having the best average with .425.
Miketish was second in the league with
.372 and Johnny Downs was third with
.352. You can see why they were the
champs. The lynx finished second in
both halves. They had good pitching
with Walkie Talkie and Rooster, but
the Mets were just too much. Sam
Lawson was a good all-around player
for the Lynx, and from what Sam has
told me the Mets better look out next
year.

The Cards and Rangers finished 3rd
and 4th respectively in this league.
They started out bad and had several
changes in management which caused
most of their downfall.
