OUR DENTAL LAB

by SHELDON GLASSHOFER

Very few people are aware of the type of work be-
ing done in our Dental Laboratory. Here, dentures
are made for all the correctional institutions in Penn-
sylvania as well as for many of our state hospitals.

The Dental Laboratory is under the capable super-
vision of Albert L. Pilch, a civilian employee of the
Correctional Industries, affectionately known as
"Doc" Pitch.

Presently, there are twelve inmates studying and
performing the many technical phases of this intricate
type of work. To learn the various steps involved in
the processing of dentures, as well as the many tech-
nical terms involved, requires a great amount of
study, patience, perseverence and aptitude.

After an inmate has gained this knowledge and he
has acquired the necessary experience—and is ready
to leave the institution—a position is obtained for
him in one of the many fine commercial laboratories.
The Delaware Valley Guild has given, and continues
to give, a great amount of cooperation in placing men
from this institutions laboratory.

Experience to date proves that men from our Den-
tal Lab are now gainfully employed and have become
respected members of society.
