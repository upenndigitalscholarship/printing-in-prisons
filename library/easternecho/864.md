‘Ole Murph’ Elevated to Editor

Francis A. Murphy, Echo’s long-time fun-
ny man of wit, humor and satire, was recently
elevated to editor-in-chief by unanimous vote
of captive scribes, who comprise the walled-in
publication’s editorial staff.

“Ole Murph,” who succeeds Don Gus-
man, recently paroled, chose layout man Fred
Adams as associate editor to bolster a some-
what anemic staff, which is now considered to
be full-blooded, in an effort to restore the edi-
torial prestige the publication previously en-
joyed.

In earlier years, the publication soared to
Canaveral heights and ranked one, two, three
with the Atlantian and Presidio, published for
nearly a half century. Ina recent survey, how-
ever, published by the Saturday Review, Echo
did not even rate an honorable mention in a
field of some 300 publications, while the At-
lantian and Presidio remain at the top of the
heap.

“Ole Murph,” who is part messiah and
part honky-tonk, impelled by a mature mind,
knows crowds don’t follow straight Bach when
it comes to journalism, promises “we’ll’’ be
back on top. ”

Sic ‘em Murph!

—Pencor Pete
