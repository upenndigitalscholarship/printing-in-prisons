CHESS
NEWS

by Martin J. Pearson

This article is dedicated to those
members of the ESP Chess Club
who form the backbone of the Club.
We give a brief resume of their
chess careers and a sample of
their play.

James Ryder joined the club in
1962, barely knowing the names of
the pieces, let alone the moves.
Through diligence in study and
practice he gradually rose from the
bottom of the rating list to a
coveted position in the top ten.

Ryder has played in the Reserve
section and last season played
three games in the Championship
section, scoring two victories
against one defeat. He has won
several awards for outstanding
performance in the Club Cham-
pionship Tournaments and for
outstanding play against visiting
clubs.

Lately, it has become evident
that there is a serious defect in
his middle and end game and
he presently is taking the neces-
sary step to correct them.

His game against Andrew
Chressanthis (U.S.C.F. Expert)
ranks as the high spot in his
young career.

William Palmer scored his first
victory for ESP in 1958 against
Temple University. This was the
first match against outside chess
teams. Palmer was transfered
shortly after this match and has
returned only recently to the club.

Though lacking his former
sharpness, Palmer shows occasion-
al signs of regaining his previous
form. He is noted for his solid
positional type of play rather
than an aggressive attacking style.

The following game well illus-
trates what happens to his oppo-
nents when they fail to counter-
act his opening set-up.

Fred Jordan could develop into
a strong player if he would de-
vote more time to the study of
the tactical and strategical aspects
of the game. He has acquired a
Superficial knowledge of most
phases of the game and this has
Placed him above the average
club member.

He has finished as high as sixth
in the Championship Tournaments
but has not been too successful
against outside competition.

Joseph Antoniewicz is another
player who advanced through the
ranks for a place in the top ten.
Twice he has finished second in
the Club Championship Tourna-
ments and was a member of the
Championship Industrial League
Teams of 1964 and 1965.

Playing third board on the
Championship Team has brought
Antoniewicz up against some of
the top players in this area, and
although he has not had a great
deal of success against them, due
to their greater theoretical knowl-
edge, his performance has been
commendable.

The following game is a good
example of what happens to op-
ponents who swim around in the
openings.

Herbert Mitchell is constantly
in and out of the ranks of the
top ten. He loves to play chess,
providing it moves at a_ brisk
pace. This passion for fast mov-
ing has cost him many a game
that should have been in the vic-
tory column. He has always been
a trifle above our average player
but he refuses to exert himself
to attain a higher rating.

Since joining the club he has
competed in two Championship
Tournaments, finishing ninth and
tenth respectively.
