EDITORIAL by Joe McNeair

Commissioners, managers and players, let’s work toward
establishing an institution Championship team this year,
and regard the game called Softball as an American sport
and play it that way.

Starting the 1958 season, a few resolutions will certainly
help keep the teams and leagues together.

Suggestive resolutions as following to:

Commissioners: I will maintain my integrity by being fair
and impartial at all times when rendering
a decision.

Managers: I will try to find what is best for the team,
and thereafter do my utmost to see that the
highest results are obtained, even though it
may mean giving up my managership.

Players: I will try to respect my manager’s judgment.
Although at times I may feel he is wrong I will
do my best to make it right, because, my main
objective when on the playing field is to play with
the team and to give my all in trying to win.

I know there may be times when I wont be
in the starting line-up, but I will not let such
cause me to sit around or leave the game grum-
bling and hoping my team loses nor will I try to
break the morale of my team-mates by criticising
my manager’s strategy.
