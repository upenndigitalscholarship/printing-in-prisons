THEMES AND VARIATIONS

by GEORGE MAKIN

Lights, camera and action at the opening of the
Spring Talent Show, March 20th, to a packed house
with the fanfare of a premiere at the Grauman.
Prizes awarded in this one, but the grand prize was
the unanimous burst of applause in the chord of
achievement, appreciation and success at the finale.

A battery of technicians from Station W.LP.,
with mikes, tape recorder, and smiles, rubbed elbows
with the customers as they wired the place for
sound. Among the early arrivals was the featured
attraction in the personalities of Bob Menefee and
Al Taylor, our radio favorites, in the company of
Mr. Banmiller, our host. These were the lights that
lit up the place with a warmth of feeling in the
cordial greeting of one and all.

A bit of comical shenanigans down front served
as an unexpected warm-up for the show. A couple
of jokers sat upright with folded arms, in deliber-
ation, wearing signs as hat bands in large bold face
type designating them as ‘‘Critic’’, ‘‘Press’’. Later,
when no one appeared at the box office for a re-
fund, the comical pair decided that critics just had
to go. It was hilarious.

The orchestra, under the direction of Joe Fatio,
played ‘‘Dancing in the Dark’’ in good taste, and
then opened the review with the theme song of the
orchestra, ‘‘My Dream Beside Me’’, an original
composition by George Makin and Johnny Greco.

Free and easy in manner, Lou Biancone, pro-
ducer, came into his own at this point as M.C. The
presence of our guests was acknowledged with
thunderous applause as they settled back in their
chairs, assuming the role of ‘‘Judges’’. A constant
change of pace, perfect timing and ad libbing by
Lou assured the success of the show.

Spotlighted now, ‘‘Slick’’ Matthews, solo gui-
tarist, gave his impression of ‘‘Prelude in C# Minor’’,
by Rachmaninoff, thus indicating his preference for
the work of the Master.

There was an appealing note and variety of song
in vocals by ‘‘Little Snooks,’’ Walt Young, Al
Jenkins, Joe Brown (who did his own composition,
“That’s Why My Baby Loves Me’’) and Jesse
Burch, flautist with the concert band, who did ex-
ceptionally well as vocalist with the orchestra. All
are to be commended and encouraged to continue the
sincere effort displayed here. They seem to have
the spark.

There was an uproar when that lovable character
of ours, ‘‘The Preacher’’, solemnly entered as the
Rajah Himself bedecked in a jeweled turban, trail-
ed by a no less lovable personage bearing the
master’s offering on a plush platter (a pillow wrap-
ped in a turkish towel) on which reposed one har-
monica. This, a scene out of Arabian Nights, rocked
the house with laughter as the Rajah ceremoniously,
with courtly bows and gestures, plucked the mouth
organ from its glamourized feather bed. Settling
to the floor, his legs disappeared under him in snake
charmer fashion as there followed a few hot licks
in what turned out to be plain down to earth Boogie
Woogie. Space doesn’t permit us to do justice to
‘“The Preacher’’ as to his extraordinary creative
ability. We comment here that a story about him,
if ever written, would be most interesting. Wish
we could do it. Our deepest appreciation to the
Rajah and his entourage.

"Phil’’, an old time hoofer who is at no time in
any particular hurry, came on stage about this time
and wrapped up the First Prize, leaving everyone
flabbergasted by a bit of fast footwork that con-
tained more steps in a few minutes than his last
performance indicated he would take in a week.
He can well rest on his laurels.

The ‘‘Charmers’’ vocal group moved with a
beat which sent a restless melody in exploration of
the past and future in search of an answer to the
question, ‘‘Whatcha Gonna Do?’’

Bright lights beamed in the next act ...a show
in itself. The company of Locke and Dupree, with
all the vernacular and spirit of the carnival, in
which ‘‘Con Man’’ Locke put down Dr. Yogey’s
Sleep Tonic, and the sucker as well, for the count.
Long enough for the flimflam artist to count the
chips. Timing here was terrific and the audience
was definitely sold on the product when Dupree
did a flip, went into a flash dance, and stamped the
label ‘‘Professional’’.

Finally, ‘‘Bobby’’, a youthful aspirant, had his
chance. It may have been his first, in this respect
at least, but not his last with us. A trumpet solo,
an achievement far above and beyond the thought
of the moment.

Mr. E. Parke Brown, Music Director and Band-
-master, accepted the merit for that department,
thanked his assistants and all who cooperated in pro-
ducing results that must surely be a source of
satisfaction and encouragement to those enlightened
visionaries who strive, against all odds, to educate
the individual and improve the general welfare of
mankind.
