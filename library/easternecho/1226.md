In

he had been buried alive
a terrible circumstance to be sure
even when considering reason
the dirt gassed him

now where are the heroes of rescue
he screamed
no one would hear him
ears were not

pressure
yet something moved...
his bowels...
a worm

the slick cool worm
in his eye
in his mind
In

be it ever so humble
