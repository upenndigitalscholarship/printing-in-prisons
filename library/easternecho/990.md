SPARTANS VS. HAWK’S OF ST. JOSEPH'’S

On April 25, 1964 the Hawks of St. Joseph's
came to the institution to visit the Spartans.
The final score was 128 to 81.

The Spartans put on a good show against
one of the top rated teams of the East.

The Spartans led by their all-time scoring
champ Samuel Brown, with 26 points, backed
up by Big Leon Wallace with 24 points. A lot
of credit should go to the other team members
of the Spartans, and Steve, the Coach.

The Hawks of St. Joseph’s, led by their
playmaker and all-American, Jimmy Lyman,
romped to a 128 to 81 victory. Lyman had 36
points, high scorer in the game, backed by
Jim Boyle with 22 points.

A lot of thanks should go to Jack Ramsey
for bringing his Hawks in for the fine ex-
hibition of talent.

On April 4, 1964, R. W. Brown Boys’ Club
visited the Spartans, here at the institution.
The Spartans won 62 to 57. The Spartans, who
played a surprisingly good game were never
behind, led by their all time scoring champ,

Samuel Brown, with 26 points. Their big
defensive ace, Leon Wallace, had only 8
points, but blocked many shots that might
have meant a difference in the score. A lot
of credit should go to R. W. Brown Boys’ for
their visit and good sportsmanship, Their
playmaker surely was a ball hawk on both
sides, defense and offense.

Bunning pitched his perfect game.
