A Dinner For 12

A banquet was held here at Eastern on Tuesday,
Oct. 13, 1959. Being present, seated at the press
table as an observer, has been for me the finest ex-
perience of nigh on to two decades of imprisonment.

Twelve men were being honored. They were
seated at the flower-banked center table, which
formed the leg of the T wherein the Toastmaster and
guests sat.

Rev. Father John J. McHugh, Catholic Chaplain,
gave the invocation.

The dinner began with shrimp cocktail followed
by tenderloin steak, french fried potatoes, peas, fried
onions, tossed salad, celery hearts, olives, pickles,
rolls, butter, ice cream with fruit, and coffee.

The inmate cooks and custodial stewards are to
be congratulated. The dinner was dispatched with
gusto by all in attendance, giving proof of the gour-
met’s touch. The service of the waiters, all inmates,
also should be extolled, — it was exemplary.

As toastmaster, Dr. Michael Morello, Director
of Treatment here at H. S. P., introduced the guest
speakers.

In his address, Arthur T. Prasse, Commissioner
of Correction, let us in on a small secret, as to who
footed the bill for the affair. He stated that the ex-
pense could possibly have been drawn from the
state’s budget, but such was not the case. The mem-
bers of the staff here at Eastern, without any fanfare,
dug into their own pockets, each contributing a share
towards the cost incurred. I know of no other inci-
dent in the past that demonstrated better inmate-
personnel relations, thus ridiculing the old bug-a-boo
that a wall of restraint must be maintained at all
times between inmates and custodians. The sincerity
of their gesture became more evident because of its
utter lack of publicity.

Space does not permit Mr. Prasse’s entire ad-
dress, or the fine talks given by Harry A. Snyder,
Ph. D., Educational specialist, and Robert H. Coates,
Director of School Extension, Phila. School System,
guest speakers.

In his off-the-cuff manner, Commissioner Prasse
extoled the manifold virtues of an education. He
lent emphasis to the values it can accrue, and the
limitlessness of the dividends it can pay. He related
the histories of several men who, after obtaining
a High School Diploma, went on to successful en-
deavors, one of them even becoming a teacher, and
later — a school principal.

The outside press was represented by Mr. James
McGee, reporter, and Jack Finney, photographer,
both of the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin.

Superintendent William J. Banmiller presented
the diplomas to the graduating class. Those gradu-
ating were: Joseph John Corvi, Robert Francis
Cullen, James Daunt, Paul Delehanty, Charles Don-
nelly (paroled), Barrett Duke (transferred),
Howard Harrison, Benjamin Jacobson (paroled),
Norman Pearson, Henry Saby (transferred), Louis
Raymond Straccioni, and Wiliam James Wright.

The benediction by Rev. McHugh brought the
evening’s festivities to a close.
