From the PHILADELPHIA DAILY NEWS

A recent letter stated that all convicts should be executed. I very strongly
disagree with the writer. Although I am only an average teen-ager, I believe
that every person deserves a second chance.

The person who wrote that letter must think he has never done anything
wrong during his entire life. Can this person look back on his life and say that
he has never cheated in a test, stolen a piece of candy, or told a lie? If so, he
should be up on a throne for all the world to look up to as diffenent, but at the
same time to look down on as the one person who is too good for the common
man to associate with.

Perhaps if this person would spend more of his time helping someone, who
has made one mistake and paid his debt to society, get back on his feet instead
of condemning them, he would be a far better person. â€”SUSAN SMITH
