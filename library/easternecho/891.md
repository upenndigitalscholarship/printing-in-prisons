Quoits

I have been advised that “Smiley”
Knowles and “‘No No’ Smith are the
giants of the Quoit courts. Following
close behind are Bob Parett, John
Belvin, John Blanton and Pete Backus.
You can always find some excellent
games going on as you tour the yard.
I understand that Sam Graham is quite
an “Artist’’ at the game also. They
tell me that when he has his pitching
arm and eye under control he has
cooled the games of many players at a
given time. If there are any doubts in
the minds of any readers here as to the
greatness of “No No” and “Smiley” as
the Champions, take a chance some-
time and play them a game.
