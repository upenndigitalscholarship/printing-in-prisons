Canine and Felix

by LARRY L. NULL

CANINE:
Felix, why is your fur so bright?
Why do your eyes glow at night?
Why do you purr so soft and nice?
Why do you eat those pretty, little mice?

FELIX:
Why? Why? Why? Is that all you can say?
If that is all, then I’ll be on my way.

CANINE:
Felix, why do you walk so soft?
Why do you climb way up in a loft?
Why do you meow when the moon is full?
Why in the summer do you look so cool?

FELIX:
Why? Why? Why? Is that all you can say?
If that is all, then I'll be on my way.

CANINE:
Felix, why do you relax with ease?
Why do you climb up in the trees?
Why? do you walk with so much grace?
Why do you constantly wash your face?

FELIX:
Why? Why? Why? Is that all you can say?
If that is all, then I’ll be on my way.

CANINE:
Felix, why do they pet you so much?
Why do you play with all that you touch?
Why ‘do you have nine chances to die?
Why do you think you're better than I?

FELIX:
Why? Why? Why? Is that all for Today?
If that is all, then I’ve something to say:

You ask me these secrets with envy and greed,
Secrets for which you'll never have need.
For if you were like I with no exceptions,
There‘d be no need for your stupid questions.
