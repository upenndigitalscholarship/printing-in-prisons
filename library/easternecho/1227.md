THE NIGHT

The most difficult part of my day comes with the evening,
it is then that I feel the surging tides of loneliness
swelling out engulfing the world that is mine alone to
settle about me,
For the night...

Dusk brings the emptiness . . . or its beginning, for the
intense chill that enhances this nothingness that is
mine alone,
Comes with the night...

Upon my pillow I lay thinking of the morrow, for with dawn comes
the sun, casting her rays of radiant warmth that thaw
quickly the chill of past hours,
The chill of the night...

With the light comes hope and promise of moments of laughter,
a smile and a friendly voice; all savored with the
fragrance of fullness. It is only these that can break
the spell of emptiness,
Emptiness that comes with the night...

Compare not the light with the night!
The contrast is striking to a point appalling.
Nothingness is her companion. Nothingness and
the ring of lamenting love echoing against the
empty loneliness of my hollow heart,
Seeking escape from the night...

I dream parties, lots of parties, just peopleparties,
for those, like I, who suffer, the night comes but
to greet one another until the dawn,
I feel the gaiety as we walk casually with festive air,
but this too brings its remorse. It is not difficult to
see, even in my dream that we who are talking so freely,
and smiling too often and laughing too loud are but
fighting the loneliness,
Loneliness that comes with the night...

With supplication I pray to awake to a new world. A world
filled with people from every way of life,
people who are individual in their thinking,
broad in intelligence,
apprehensive people with love in their lives
People to shatter the night...

I pray to find a person who I can share all the joy...
for there must be beauty in this world!
A person to whom I can give the love of my heart,
a lamenting love now, that resounds within the
empty loneliness of my hollow heart,
Waiting for relief of the night...

Terry Baulkman
