FORMER NAZI PRISONER LENDS
HELPING HAND TO MEN BEHIND BARS

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (UPI)—Leo Seligman has been trapped by his own
kindness, and he doesn’t mind it a bit.

The stout, pink-faced little man who survived a Nazi concentration camp
has helped 968 ex-convicts readjust to life on the ‘‘outside,’’ and each day, he
gets “10 or 15 letters" from others asking for help.

"I only have time for this,” he said. “I wouldn’t stop and I couldn’t
stop."

Seligman has spent at least $12,000 helping prisoners. But he’s no million-
aire dabbling in charity. Friends say he lost his grocery store giving away food
to his ‘‘children’’—the prisoners he helps. Now he runs a small catering firm
with his wife’s help.

“When a man gets out of prison, he needs help fast, and with no red
tape," Seligman said.

Seligman contacts men in prison and helps get them paroles. He finds
them a job and a place to stay, gives them ‘“‘spending money’’ and food if they
need it and introduces them to the pastor of a church of their choice.

Seligman boasts that only 17 of his "children’’ committed new offenses
after being released from prison to him.
