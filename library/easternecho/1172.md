VIKINGS
The Vikings, under the guidance of Fred Goodman,
are in the process of making things interesting for the rest
of the league, despite the fact they have never before play-
ed together as a unit or team. Billy Carter, “Rosy” Minter,
Frank Lucas, Levi Jones, Henry Buckery, Rumaine Ruley,
Otis Martin, Floyd Ellis, Ronald Jackson, “Dutch”. Baggly,
“Big John’’ McCandless, Dave Diefenderfer and “Brother”
Goodman himself round out a scrapping crew of Vikings.

Overcoming an early season period of disunity, the
Vikings came on strong with the acquisition of some new
personnel. Eddie Brewer, pitcher; “Hawk’’ Hawkins, a
good infielder, and “Chico” Morales combined to bolster
the few “trouble’’ spots the team had.

Always the optimist, “Goodie” has assured me his
team will have even more to “‘say’’ as the year ends. Good
luck, Vikings, the newest entry in the ESP softball wars.
