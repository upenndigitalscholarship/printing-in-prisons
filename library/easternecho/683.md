With the ‘60-61 Winter Season a thing of the past, the Eastern
League is off to a flying start, as four well matched teams take
to the hard wood (Figuratively speaking.) The Spartans, have
been well split up as Manager Blackie Battles, elected to cast
his lot with Norman Pearson’s Baron’s, and team Captain, Alvin
‘‘Shakey’’ Young entered a team of his own, The Warriors, into
league competition. Juice Cohen will manage one of the other
teams, while Horace ‘‘Tuffy’’ Wright will pilot a new quintet,
The Vagabonds.

With the One Block Basketball taking most of the rookies
into the fold, and the softball season at hand, the Eastern
League will see few new faces and should boast the cream of
the institutions’ basketball players.

THE VAGABONDS—Tuffy Wright, Manager

The teams strength lies in the confidence of the starting five,
a group that has played a number of outside teams and isn’t
easily flustered when the pressure is on. Under the boards
‘‘Jake the Snake’’ Welty and Big Bernard have size, weight
and knowledge to control the rebounding situation. In the center
spot, two players of equal ability will probably alternate. Donny
Weiss has the height to block any drives up the key but Bill
Barnes is a more aggressive player and will be an asset under
both, offensive and defensive boards. Up front the Vagabonds
have a steady trio in John O’Brien, Harl Brown and Sam Simo-
netti. O’Brien, the teams quarterback is an exponent of the
deliberate type offense and set patterns while Sam is a bear on
defensive manoeuvers. When the team goes into the fast break,
Earls’ wizardry with the roundball will come into its own. With
so few players to start, Tuffy will probably see a lot of action
himself,

THE WARRIORS—Alvin Young, Manager

Going with the old adage that the race goes to the swiftest,
Shakey Young has come up with one of the speediest fore court
duo’s in the league. Billy Holley and Bill Hollowell will give
opposing players the fits as they fly up the court on a Boston
Celtic type fast break . Under the backboards, Jake Hass and
Little Mace are the key to the teams success as both must give
height and weight to opposing teams. However, Shakey may
make up for this deficit if his play this year comes up to the
standard he set in the winter league. Alternating at the for-
ward position, with Haas and Mae will be Al Shep and Crazy
Herbhave plenty of scoring potential. Your reporter will try
his hand with this team.

THE VANDALS—Juice Cohen, Manager

The fortunes of the Vandals will rest on the shoulder and
shooting arm of Elijah Sheperd, one of the leagues better
scorers. Under the offensive boards, two work horses, John
Wheeler and Dave Croxton will have to be particularly aggres-
sive if this team hopes to make the grade. The front court will
have a slight advantage over a few teams as both Juice and Joe
Smiley can fast break and play a lot of defensive ball. Ad-
ditional encouragement comes with Joe Antoniwiez who has im-
proved in his rebounding abilities, and if Chuck Floyd lives up
to expectations there will be a number of upsets.

THE BARONS—Norman Pearson, Manager

Possessor of Hastern’s two tallest players, Cochise Bell and
Lomax, the Barons appear to have the rebounding edge over
rival teams from the start. Lomax, particularly, is an invalu-
able asset at forward, destroying enemy defensive with a soft
jump shot. At the other forward spot, Blackie Battles will be
shooting for the league rebounding title, and with his spirit has
a good chance at gaining the crown. Taking the pressure off
Lomax, Rob Erwin has a variety of shots that will probably see
him among the scoring leaders at the end of the season. Norm,
will probably start himself at the other guard spot in an effort
to keep his team steady. Joe Massanova is capable of alternat-
ing at either forward or guard while two rookies, Preacher and
Ski hope to crack the starting line.

THE ANONYMOUS CAMERA

The Spartans, who won the Eastern League Championship by
defeating the Mystics in four straight play-off games, were
cheered, jeered and booed by those members of the league who
felt the sting of their scoring and rebounding attack. It was all
in fun however, as the majority of the audience at the sports
banquet approved of Blackie and Shakey, Manager and Capt.,
getting the Trophy, which Mr. Thompson, the Athletic Director,
presented.

For the Spartans, who started off the season with an eight
game losing streak, the championship crown was a well deserved
honor. The acquisition of Lomax was one of the major factors
in the drive to the type. Members of the winning team were:
Bogardus, Big Jim, Lomax, Shakey, Blackie, Roosevelt,O ’Bie,
Sam, Billy Carter and Jack Haas. The addition of Haas came
at an opportune time as Big Reds Bogardus was traded to the
street. Jim was also released but Juice Wilson and Sonny Mays
took his place in the playoffs.

Second place went to Little Mae and his Mystics who lost all
thier talent in the passing of Harry Fricker. Barnes ‘retired?
and Woody made commute, but they still fought like Champs.
The load was too much for Crazy Herb, Bernard, Juice, Tuffy
and A.A. Joe to carry. Norman and Chuck didn’t see too much
action.

Before losing their top three, Mac and his five beat the Pan-
thers three out of five for the shot at the champs.

In third place, the Panthers had the leagues best in Billy
Holley, the fastest man on the court, and also the team manager.
Helping on the breaks and shooting from the outside was Elijah
Sheperd while under the boards, Jake the Snake, Wheeler, Dave
Croxton, Donny Wise, Cochise, and Al Shep were tough. Earl
Brown was great as a playmaker, but the shock of losing the
first two games put them behind in spirit as well as the scoring
column.

"FOUL" SHOTS—
Big Daddy Elmer Ford was a familiar sight at the Champion-
ship games, cheering for Shakey to win at the expense of the
Mystics, who looked at him with mixed emotions. Big Daddy is
one funny man.

Holley should have received some sort of trophy for being the
best all ’round player in the league, ‘‘the image of Elgin Bay-
lor."

Saby and B. Hollowell are coming out of retirement and will,
I believe, help their team more than a little.

The league lost the greatest—Harry Fricker

Crazy Herb ‘‘retires’’ more than anyone I know, but Barnes
is giving him a good run for the money.

Shakey is the adversary of every official.

Lomax will continue to be the Leagues Highest Scorer.
