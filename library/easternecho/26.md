BY MAN

The ugliness one sees
in the world
is Beauty and Truth
horribly mutilated
by man
using the hammer and chisel
of greed and tyranny...

MONARCH INVINCIBLE

Carved by the tireless hand of time,
the grey bluff, its bold steep face deeply searred,
stands with cleft feet tightly imbedded
in the cold sands of antiquity
and stares stoically out over the heaving breast
of the restless sea;

the rising sun adorns its crown
with a glorious halo,
drapes a garment of soft spun gold
over its wide shoulders
and caresses its granite cheeks
with compassionate warmth;

white tipped wavelets race mérrily along the shore
and caress its feet playfully,
and a rhythmic song of the sea rises and faHs
on the placid wings of a breeze,
while harmony pervades the atmosphere
to encircle its massive form
with the gentle arms of quietude. . .

A rancorous-wind, wearing the scarlet robe of chaos
creeps from its ethereal edifice
and beats with, implacable fury
against its roughly hewn brow;

white-crested waves beat furiously upon the shore,
and pouring rains drench its erown
and swift running rivulets cut deeper
the jagged scars in its rugged face;

the fog sweeps in.on wraithlike wings;
clings to its massive form with, sticky fingers,
and stifles day
with a tightly woven net of grey mist,
which only the wailing voice of the wind
and the raucous shrick of a gull
seem able to penetrate ;

but if one listens closely enough
a voice from the bluff can be heard to say,

"I am Man! Invincible Monarch of the Universe!"

VICTORY

When daylight softly walks
across the misty hills of morn
and! bathes the earth
with tranquil rays of light
it holds aloft in jewelled hand
the glowing torch
of victory over night. . .

ARISE AND WALK

A tiny blade of grass
will rise again
when crushed by tempests,
ice, and rain;
so why can’t man arise,
when crushed by fear and strife
and firmly walk, his eyes on stars,
the fruitful road of life. . .

PARABLES

He who has no perception of love
and creates for himself
a world of ugliness
will ultimately create
his own darkness
and perish therein. . .
and he who hates another —
shall build beneath
the altar of his own soul
a self-consuming flame. . .
