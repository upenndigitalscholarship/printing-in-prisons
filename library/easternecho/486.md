THE ROAD

by Larry L. Null

I walked the straight and narrow line, 
but somehow fell a step behind; 
I made a turning at a fork ahead, 
this is where the new road led. 

It led to shame, sorrow and grief, 
with little of happiness and relief; 
I thought it would lead to fame, 
but, I was wrong—it never came. 

There was a time I gave a thought,
to try anew if I got turned about;
But having tried one crime, and then another.
donw that crooked road I went further.

The longer the road the heavier the pack,
there was just no turning back;
I think I’ve wandered too far; My Friend,
for this road I found, does have an end.
