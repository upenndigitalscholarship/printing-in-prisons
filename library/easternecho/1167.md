CONGRATULATIONS

Charles ‘‘Mutt’’ Holden, representing the Falcons soft-
ball team, compiled the following pitching record: 94 in-
nings pitched, including 3 no-hitters in succession, one ten
inning no-hitter in which the game ended in a scoreless
tie, and’ four other shutouts. His won-loss record of ten
wins, one loss, for a fantastic E.R.A. of 1.12 is indeed
worthy of recognition.
