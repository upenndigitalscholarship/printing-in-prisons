PROFILE

Professor of Sociology and Anthropology Negley K. Teeters, a University faculty
member since 1927, is an internationally recognized authority on criminology.

He is the author of 10 books on criminology and penology. “New Horizons in
Criminology,’’ which is now in its third printing, and ‘‘The Challenge of Delinquency,’’
written in 1950 with John O. Reinemann, are used as text books in over 100 colleges.

Dr. Teeters is a member of the Governor’s Committee on Correctional Matters and Presi-
dent of the Pennsylvania Prison Society.

In 1944 Dr, Teeters was awarded a grant from the Department of State to make
a study of prisons in several South American countries.

Dr. Teeters’ two major projects last year, when he was on sabattical leave, were
a study of chain gangs in the South and the reading of a paper at the International
Conference of Applied Psychologists in Rome.

He received his A.B. from Oberlin College in 1920, his A.M. and Ph.D. from Ohio
State University in 1925 and 1931, respectively.
