PACKERS

This team consisted of the most experienced
and, I might add, the oldest players in the league.
Such familiar names as Lightkep, “Chink,’’ Eddie
Brewer, C.C. Clark, S. Cantoral, Harry Zietz, Norm
Pearson, Richie Richardson, Charley Gindle, John
“Lujack,” “Cochise’’ Bell, “Teazy’’ Brumskill, and
“Rocky” Negri; combined with the youth of Stan
Moroz, “Kookie’’ Nash, Eddie Brooks, ‘‘Smiley”’
Crowson, Dennis Shields and ‘Skippy’ Siegrist,
comprised a formidable array of talent which went
for naught. Injuries to several key players early in
the season played havoc with the grandoise plans
the Packers entertained for winning the champion-
ship in 1965.

Plans are already underway for a bigger and
better year, next season. Good luck, “Old Folks!’’
