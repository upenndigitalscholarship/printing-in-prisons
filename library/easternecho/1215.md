VERDI

Have you ever thought of a colors flavor?
Wondered what food has rts colors savor?
What tastes black or red? What tastes yellow?
This problem can make a bumpkin of most any fellow.

Perhaps at last I have found the one,
That tastes as tt looks sitting out in the sun.
A vegetable of which I am not very keen,
Celery is its name, a taste of green green green.

Wallander
