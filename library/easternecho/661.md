From the
Superintendent's Desk

I believe that in light of the situation that occurred in this institution since the
last issue of the Echo that I would be remiss if ] were not to mention the
effect that the actions of so few can have on so many men.

Because of this thoughtless action, as you know, it has been necessary for
certain changes to be made. However, these changes are for the good of all our men.

We, in the Bureau, shall continue to arrange programs for the benefit of the
men who wish to participate so that they will be able to meet the challenge of adjust-
ing to the problems that must be met when they are released from the institution into
free society. To do otherwise, would be to negate the very ideals and philosophy for
which the Bureau of Correction in Pennsylvania is so well known—not only na-
tionally, but internationally.

We all know that custody and correction are one and the same. The Bureau is
more than willing to give every man a chance to prove himself—but we must remem-
ber—it is a two way street - not a one way and not his ways. This is true no matter
the race or creed, and to belabor this point would be superfluous and redundant.

Boiled down, we can ask only—“Why is it that we mortals seem to have such diffi-
culty in differentiating between right and wrong?” I believe you will be interested
in the articles in this issue which explain the M’Naghten Rule and the Durham Rule
—and irresistible impulse!

As previously stated, only a few men created the situation and are responsible
for the necessary corrective steps that have been taken. It would seem axiomatic that
men in a setting such as this need and want to be told what to do and when. This
does not necessarily mean nor imply that men cannot better themselves. The con-
structive programs are still available for those men who are sincere in their wish to
make a better life for themselves. As you all know, a program is no better than you
wish to make it.

Our congratulations and thanks to the men who remained loyal to us during
those troubled few hours.

William J. Banmiller
