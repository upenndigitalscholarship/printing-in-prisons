“MUSCLE BEACH” SCENE

With summer upon us once again, the weight court
has been crowded to capacity with lifters, builders, and
those plain interested in getting into some sort of “shape.”
Old familiar faces include: Grandy, Joyner, Archey, Herb,
Knox, “G.I.” Joe and “Chief.” A whole host of new men 
also work out daily. (Spare me fellows, Ill get around to
“yo’all” next issue.)
