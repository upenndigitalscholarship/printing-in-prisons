FINAL STANDINGS

              WON  LOSS.  Pts.Sc.   Opp. Sc.
Conquerors     7    1      163        11
Packers        3    5       42        56
Red Devils     2    6       12       150

A special tribute is due to the very capable
officiating of Bill Schaeffer, Herb Allen, John Gil-
more, and Frank Smith (to Norm Pearson and
Russell Budd who also officiated before joining
teams as players) whose efforts in a thankless task
contributed greatly toward making the season a
successful and interesting one.

To all, participants and fans alike, the sports-
manship displayed throughout the year is a credit
to each and every individual.

Next season should prove to be an exceptional
one. The latest. scouting reports indicate an abun-
dance of young, large, muscular people professing
to be line-men, backs, etc. So lets all look forward
to a "rock ‘em, sock ‘em” 1966.
