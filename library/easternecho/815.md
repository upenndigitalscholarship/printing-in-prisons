The Quarantine League which got its beginning
last year, has really gotten underway this year of
1962. It is utterly impossible to give each teams
roster since these are the new recruits that enter these
portals and are not destined to stay here. For they
are processed while in quarantine, thus, are shipped
to other institutions which are beyond their control.
I’m only able to give some of the highlights of these
games. Try to bear along with me since this is the
first bit of writing that involves this particular seg-
ment of the institution. The league which formerly
comprised six teams, and after some deep invest-
igation of the league, we found it to be far better if
only four teams were put in action, this enhances
the opportunity of more players having a chance to
play. Each team consists of seventeen players on
their roster which permits each one a fair go at the
game.

In the first half of their season the ‘‘Robbins’’
came in first, with the other teams as follows; Blue
Jays, Bums, Phillies, Twisters and Scranton in that
order. The Robbins had a very strong club, thus,
had no serious problems in winning top slot during
the race. Many of the original players have left the
scene and probably are wondering how their team
made out. They won very big, fellows. With the
Blue Jays close behind and climbing fast to overtake
the league leader, but couldn’t quite catch them.
The rest of the field tried to stay in contention but
faltered in their attempt. The Bums lost five of their
key players, due to transfer within two weeks and
therefore had to go through a rebuilding stage.
Some of these new fellows have never played the
game and are playing the game as best they can and
enjoying themselves while in action.

There's always great excitement during these
games, the various rooters and fans are always out in
full force and giving the different players a rough
way to go — especially whenever they commit an
error or make some outstanding play on the field.
This tends to put a player on his toes thereafter. The
quarantine brand of softball is mostly different since
they get more kicks from batting than in chasing a
long deep fly to the outfield; or a hard smash to an
infielder. Some of ‘em wield mighty potent sticks
and carry a speedy pair of legs upon the base paths.
Its the youngsters that get the most out of the game-
for it gives them an outlet in which to explode some
of their pent-up emotions; which | find is a very good
thing especially under these circumstances.

In their area of the yard they have access to play-
ing basketball, handball, Bocce Ball and the strenu-
ous art of weight lifting. As of late Ive noticed a
great number of these fellows in “‘blue’’ have taken
up weight lifting as their daily exercise. Mr Kennedy
has stressed that this country needs more healthy
youngsters in order to build their moral standards
that has been lacking in the past. This is indeed a
fitting program and ought to be continued daily.

After the completion of the regular softball sea-
son a play-off will begin to decide the championship
of this league. So far the Phillies lead the loop, and
Hicks, their able manager has kept his team hustling
all the way. At present his is the team to beat; and
they are looking good. The other three clubs are
battling just as hard to stay in contention for all the
marbles are at stake during the final segment of the
season. There is no doubt they are eager to stay atop
the leagues standings, but the Bums are breathing
down their necks. It will be quite an exciting race
from here on in for it shows with their every game on
the field, so be it.

FLASH ! ! ! ! FLASH ! ! ! ! ! The Bums have just 
just taken over first place.

Teams       Manager   Won  Lost
Bums        “Monk"    8     4
Phillies    Hicks     8     5
Robbins     Painter   5     5
Blue Jays   “Andy     1     8

My thanks to “Big John” for keeping me up to
date with my tabulations and other data which has
been helpful to me in keeping the league in order.
