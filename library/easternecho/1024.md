INVICTUS IN REVERSE
OR
MAN! AM I A COWARD

Out of the night that uncovers me
Its black as the pit from pole to pole;
I hate whatever Gods may be
For my scared and shakey soul.

in the fell clutch of circumstance,
I have winced and cried aloud,
Under the bludgeonings of chance,
My head is bloody and itâ€™s bowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds me worried and afraid.

It matters not how straight the gait.
How charged with punishment the scroll,
I am not the master of my fate,
I'm just a convict growing old.
