WARRIORS NIP HAWKS
FOR
EASTERN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP

by Charles M. Tobin

The Warriors went hunting for victory and the
Championship which, in surprising fashion they
found. Led by ‘‘Teeny’’ Berry, who played out-
standing ball, the Warriors walked off the Cherry
Hill court with the 1957-58 Championship after win-
ning two straight games from the Hawks by scores of
68-62 and 57-49. It was basketball, played very
capably, with many sideline fans cheering loudly
for their favorites.

For the happy Warriors, it was victory and joy.
For the Hawks, it may have been distressing, but
the actual play (watched by this reporter) and the
scores of both games should give the fighting Hawks,
led by Harry Fricker, a measure of satisfaction for
a battle well fought.

From the opening tap-off, it was a head-on,
man-to-man series with clever ball-handling and
deadly shooting. It was noticeable to the viewers
that the Hawks scored easily from all points on the
court when able to gain possession of the ball but,
the Warriors proved to be superior on the boards
with Richard Herald and Bogardus doing a stand-
out job.

In both games, the Warriors seemed to take
control of the situation with five minutes of playing
time remaining. The unorthodox ball-handling of
Norman and the cat-like speed of Woody seemed to
confuse the Hawks. This reporter feels that this
was the margin of victory for the Warriors in both
games,

One could not view this game without giving
three cheers to: Junebug, Gallagher, Heads and
Pinky Andrews for their efforts in the Hawks’
strong play. And in closing, a vote of thanks to
Speedy Griffin and Horace ‘‘Toughy’’ Wright, the
referees of the first and second games, respectively.
