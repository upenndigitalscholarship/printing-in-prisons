A POINT TO PONDER . . . .

A prosperous man visits a long time friend and
says, ‘‘I am a humble man and owe my success and
happiness to my ever present state of humility.’’

“Then, why don’t you join me here?’’ his friend
replied.

‘‘Whatever possessed you to make a horrid state-
ment like that?’’ the perplexed visitor asked.

‘‘Because my friend,’’ the profound thinker an-
swered, ‘‘be it ever so humble, there is no place more
humble than a penitentiary !’’

—Frank Rouse
