THE STONES WILL CRY OUT

How many stones are there in the forty-foot wall
which encloses you all day and me part of each day?
Probably no one knows, but everyone does know that each
and everyone of them (even the mortar in between) is
thoroughly disliked. Even I don’t like them, because they
prevent me from getting in and out in a hurry. As a
matter of fact, | can think of only two good reasons for
such a massive pile: first, the walls protect us from the
characters outside; secondly, they remind me and you, too,
if you think about it, of an incident in the Gospel.

“And when He (our Lord) was now coming near the descent of
Mouni Olivet, the whole multitude of His disciples began with joy to praise
God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works they had seen.

"Saying: Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord,
peace in heaven and glory on high.”

“And some of the Pharisees, from amongst the multitude, said to
Him: Master, rebuke thy disciples.”

“To whom He said: I say to you, that if these shall hold their peace,
the stones will cry out.” St. Luke 19, 37-40.

And what message is our pile of stones prepared to cry out? Well,
if they had begun talking as soon as the Quakers cemented them together,
they would still be proclaiming that Christ is God and is He “Who being
in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal to God: but emptied
Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men,
and in habit found as a man.’ Philippians 2,6-7.

Certainly a man in a penitentiary must at times wonder if anyone
really cares. That is why the stones (Which lovingly protect you!)
would keep repeating the sublime truth of the Incarnation, that God the
Father so loves you, that He gave His only begotten Son to be your brother
in the flesh, that God the Son so loves you, that He “emptied Himself” and
became like unto you, that God the Son so loves you that He overshadowed
the purest of virgins, that She might bring forth your Savior.

You are never uncared for. God leves you with unutterable love.
Why would God “bother” to make the universe? He could not need
anything or anybody. He is totally sufficient in Himself. Think it over and
you will come to St. John’s solution: ‘God is love.”’ The universe was to be
a theatre where creatures capable of loving or rejecting Him would make
their choice and could qualify for an eternity of loving Him face to face.

In the passage of time some men rejected God. Time after time
He delivered His confused creatures from their self-imposed slavery by
sending them holy men and women who pointed the way to freedom. But
no creature however holy, could satisfactorily deliver man. Wherefore,
God prepared for the central fact of history, the birth of Jesus Christ. So
that there might be no doubts about the coming of Christ, God put into the
mouths of prophets unmistakable signs by which we might know Him.

“Thou Bethlehem Ephrata out of thee shall come forth unto Me He
who is to be ruler in Israel; and His going forth is from the beginning unto
the days of eternity.”

“Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and His name shall
be called Emmanuel.”

The additional utterances of Daniel, Isaias, Zacharias and David,
all identify Jesus as the Son of God made man.

And we? How fortunate we are to live in the period when these
prophecies have been fulfilled! We refer to the words of Gretta Palmer,
one-time atheist: “The great event, the watershed of belief, is the
discovery of the Divinity of Our Lord. As this fact cracked the world in
two, it also cracks the convert’s life in two. He has come out of a dark
cave into the Light of the World.”

With apologies to Miss Palmer, I would borrow her words and say;

The Divinity of Christ can also crack these forty-foot walls and
allow us to see that God has always and will always care for us with
infinite love.
