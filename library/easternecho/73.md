CLAIRVOYANT PREDICTIONS

Ye olde goosebone prophet will dig out the
Crystal Ball and attempt to predict how the big
leagues will finish this year. As I peer into the
Crystal Ball, all I see is a perfect vacuum. Oops!
just realized I have been staring at an associate
editor’s skin-head by mistake. Now, I take up the
musty Crystal, rub off several layers of dust, and
stare into the magic orb. First, I see an empty
void; then a shadowy finger moves and the follow-
ing message appears:

AMERICAN LEAGUE

1st place: New York: Best all-around team.
MacDougal will play short and Martin will
handle the keystone sack. Casey Stengel will
do the skull-dugging.

2nd place: Boston: The addition of Mickey Ver-
non and Bob Porterfield will put the Sox into
contention. Mike Higgins will do the master-
minding.

3rd place: Chicago: Marty Marion’s team has a
strengthened outfield, but weakened at short
with the departure of Chico Carrasquel.

4th place: Cleveland: Old man time has caught
up with the Indians. However, pitchers lke
Herb Score, Narleski and Mossi will keep them
in the first division.

5th place: Detroit: The Tigers will have longer
claws this year. Kaline, Kuenn and Boone are
the big stripes on the Tiger: Could surprise.

6th place: Baltimore: Team needs rebuilding and
retreading. Paul Richards is good skipper but
needs time to build.

7th place: Kansas City: Club has a long way to
go; Boudreau needs help

8th place: Washington: The Nats will finish in
the American League.

NATIONAL LEAGUE

1st place: Brooklyn: The Bums all the way.
Power, pitching and bench will see them to the
bunting and will repeat in the World Series.

2nd place: Milwaukee: The Braves will come
close. Mathews will hit 50 Home Runs and a
dog will run across the outfield on July 4th.

3rd place: Philadelphia: The Phils after a bad
start will make noises like big leaguers. We
envision them buying three 39 year old players
and proclaiming loudly that they strengthened
their weak spots.

4th place: New York: The Giants will not be so
Giant this year, unless they have another
miracle on Coogan’s Bluff.

5th place: Cincinnati: The Reds have the power,
but are slow afoot and need pitching. We
predict that a holiday will be celebrated in
Cincinnati on the fourth day in July.

6th place: St. Louis: The Cardinals need pitching,
but any team that has Stan the Man and Red
Scheondiest will always be dangerous.

7th place: Chicago: The Cubs have a good double
play combo, but are still the Cubs.

8th place: Pittsburgh: The beginning of the end
of the middle.
