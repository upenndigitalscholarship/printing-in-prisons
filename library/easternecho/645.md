OUTSIDE GAMES

A new ruling was established in the Cuban League for
the 1960 Outside Game Competition selections—. The All-
Star Team system used during the 1959 season was abol-
ished—. The four teams in the league now play our visitors
on a rotation basis computed from the league standings—.

May 7, 1960 was the season’s opener with the Dodgers
roosting in first place in league competition—they were
elected to host the Reliable A.A. managed by Mattie
Henry—. In a well played game, Jorden and Big Dave
joined forces to down Reliable 8 to 3 besting Waters wh»
Curley a tremendous home run and Bobby a booming
triple.

Phil Locke and his Braves took the field Sat., May 14
against Loper’s Camden All-Stars and with ‘‘Jabbo Wyatt’’
matching pitches with George Kalvitis this was a tremend-
ous game—Manager Locke remarked before the game “I
can’t beat the inside team how can I beat these people—.”
Manager Locke, though you were bested 5 to 2 you have
no reason to feel ashamed, your Braves played a remarkable
game—.

Those mighty Giants took time from their winning
streak in league competition to trounce John Parks and his
North Phila. Panthers unit May 21. The Giants, hot and
inspired from a Dodger victory earlier sent Peanuts to the
mound to oppose W. Leo—the Giants were victors by an
8 to 1 score with Peanuts chalking up 12 strikeouts—Leo
hurling for the visitors wracked up 14 strikeouts, but the
Giants determination brought home the victory to manager
George Tucker—.

To close out the first round of outside game compet-
ition—The Falcons tied Pichard’s Cafe 4 to 4—It was the
Falcons best game of the season, because the Falcons played
as a team—but it just seemed that on Sat., May 28, the
Falcons couldn’t muster the oomph to push the winning run
across in the bottom of the seventh—.

It proved one thing to us here—the Falcons can play
ball as a team.
