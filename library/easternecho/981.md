NEW BOOKS FOR LIBRARY

SCIPHA, Sept. 15, 1964 — The new book pur-
chase has been geared to the current reading in-
terests of the population. The 324 books repre-
sent a wide selection in the fields of notable books
of the year, mystery and intrigue, historical novels,
books with ethical and Spiritual connotations,
fiction of fantasy and science, and sports.

There will also be a rather good distribution of
non-fiction ranging from mysteries of the sea to
the wonders of the sky as well as, for a change,
books that will at least give us a glimmer of what
went on 1000 and more years ago — there is such
a thing as history!

These are your books, so please display the
proper cooperation to insure their prompt return
to the library in good condition after they have
been read by you.
