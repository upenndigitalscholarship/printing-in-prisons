Worth Remembering

Education is essentially a thing of the spirit. It is the responsive heart
and the skilled hand. It is the quickened mind and the healthy body. It is the
creative unfolding of human life. It is the stuff from which come competent
parents and responsible citizens. In its essential expression education has
a fundamental spiritual quality.

â€”Don A. Orton
