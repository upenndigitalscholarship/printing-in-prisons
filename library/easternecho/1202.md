CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

“Despite the evidence, people argue from some
weird intution that they still believe that capital
punishment does deter capital crimes. I am re-
minded of Detective Sgt. William Mulrine III of
Delaware. Delaware abolished capital punish-
ment in 1958. In 1960 there were two murders
by Negroes at a time whenthe public was aroused
by civil-rights demonstrations. Capital punish-
ment was restored against the governor’s veto
and the bar association’s recommendation. Ser-
geant Mulrine argued that he knew that capital
punishment was a deterrent and a deserved pun-
ishment. Ten days after restoration, Sergeant
Mulrine killed his wife for which he served two
years !’’
