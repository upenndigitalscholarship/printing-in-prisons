The Eastern Echo Asks....

‘‘Can prison labor be used to better advantage?”

Clarence L. Howard
“Yes, in view of the fact that society has not realized any return on the momes
expended on their prisons, there exists the possibility that better use can be
made of the man-power incarcerated within wall. Such benefits as preser-
vation of forests, flood controls, soil erosion or expanded highway systems can
be derived for the public benefit. The sense of being a part of the world with-
out will enable the inmate to feel a pride of ownership and bring about a feeling
of responsibility towards society at large. This latter being a step towards
rehabilitation.”

William Horn
“The present system is unfair to many of the inmates who, because of limited
facilities, will just waste their time here. Vocational training should be ex-
panded to afford everyone a chance to return to society better equipped and
adjusted to remain outside.” :

Willie Williams
“The state government and its agencies use and pay to maintain hundreds of
varied types of business machines—calculators, typewriters and adding machines,
etc. The setting up of a vocational program with practical and theoretical
traning in the reconditioning and maintenance of these machines would not
only be a financial advantage to the state but would equip men with as Billed
trade that would be an asset to them upon release.”

Richard H. Driscole
“Prison labor would be greatly benefited by a well balanced vocational program,
backed by Labor and Industrial leaders. Our program today is mosily theo-
retical with litle opportunity to practice and get experience.”

Thomas Karas
“I feel that the Prison Industries are doing an important job in teaching men
here skillful trades that will make them an asset to their communities. The
Print Shop offers such training as Linotypist, Compositor, Press Operator, etc.
However, facilities are limited, and the shop can only train just so many men.
This type of training should be expanded.”

Paul Goff
“Most certainly! Utilizing inmate labor in such instances as forestry, fish
hatcheries and conservation could become a valuable asset to the individual in-
mate as well as to the commonwealth. Any step toward a planned vocational
program would be a sound investment. The dividend?....... Better citizens.”

Jerry Hess
“Prison labor can be used to better advantage in Eastern State Penitentiary’s
Dental Laboratories by a planned and executed training program whereby the
student would be first taught Dental Anatomy, Theory, Basic Pricinpals and
finally the Art of Denture Construction.”

David Morrison
“The state’s penitentiaries should organize a labor force to be used in emergen-
cies such as the recent flood. They can be rushed to the affected areas and do
yeoman service in flood control and in restoration of the area.
