"OLD HINK"
George “Baron” Hinkel

by Knarf Yhprum

They come and they go,
from this island of woe,
And they talk of music, women,
and drink.
But I want you to know
of a “Jazz Combo, ”
And a guy they called,
“Old Hink.”

He wasn't too young,
nor not very old,
But his ways were regular,
and set.
His hair was all silver,
not any gold,
And he played
his old clarinet.

He had a Basin Street beat
in all of his fingers,
And a Bourbon Street beat,
in his shoes
The ballads he played,
were the kind that lingers
And you cried,
when he played the blues.

He could play Boogie Woogie,
and really scat,
And Sam would inquire,
“what key is that?”
Joe would laugh
and give Sam a pat,
And say, “naturally man,
it's in B - FLAT."

There were, Sam and Murph,
Melvin and Joe,
Val and one other
I think;
But the one we'll miss,
when he has to go,
Is a guy they call,
“OLD HINK."
