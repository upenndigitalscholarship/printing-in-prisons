Congratulations

Our since departed Athletic Director
J. S. Thompson was presented with a
Sportsman's Award by Gus Force on
behalf of the participating personnel
as the outstanding benefactor towards
the elevation of the sports program at
this institution. We want to wish Mr.
Thompson lots of luck in his new
position.

At this time I would like to person-
ally congratulate the above recipients
and wish them continued success in the
future—inside and outside the walls.
May the year 1963 produce an even
greater amount of fresh new talent.
The above athletes proved their worth
as recipients of the trophies; this I’m
quite sure will boost the morale of the
sporting program here for a long time
to come. E.S.P. has always produced
an array of great talented athletes past
and present. Let’s keep up the good
work.
