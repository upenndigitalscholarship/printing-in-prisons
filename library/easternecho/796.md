IF

“On the other hand, if the society can be sufficiently objective and understanding in
not having to burn psychotics as witches or punish offenders as criminals; if the society can
express its aggressions through football, boxing, politics, and TV stories; then the prison
can assume its function of treating the socially ill with the best methods of which we are
aware.”

From “Blueprint for the Progressive Prison" by Vernon Fox, Ph.D.,
in the June-1956 Issue of FEDERAL PROBATION
