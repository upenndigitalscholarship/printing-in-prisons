ATTN. CONVICT:
BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING!

... We see the style of life under certain con-
ditions of environment, and it is our task to
analyze its exact relation to the existing cir-
cumstances, since our mind changes with altera-
tion of the environment. As long as a person is
in a favorable situation we cannot see his style
of life clearly. In new situations, however,
where he is confronted with difficulties, the style
of life appears clearly and distinctly ... The
style of life is a unity because it has grown out
of the difficulties of early life and out of the
striving for a goal.

Alfred Adler (1870-1937)
