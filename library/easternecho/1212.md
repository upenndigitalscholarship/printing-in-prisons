MEDITATION OF GOOD
WILL FOR ALL BEINGS

May all beings be happy and serene!
May they be joyous and live in safety!
All beings, whether weak or strong,
Small or great, without exception,
In high, niddle, or low realms of existence,
Visible or invisible, near or far,
Born or yet to be born:

May all beings be happy and at their ease.
Let none deceive another,
Nor despise any being in any state.
Let none in anger or ill will wish harm to another,

Even as a mother watches over her child,
her only child,
So with boundless mind should one cherish
all living things.
Radiating friendliness over the whole world,
above, below, and all around without limit.
So let us cultivate boundless good will.

â€” META SUTA (Buddhist)
