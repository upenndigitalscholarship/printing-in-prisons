Foundation Award To Eastern Inmates

Say, we’re so proud, why, we're almost bursting our vests. And, we have all the
right in the world for feeling this way.

You see, last winter, the LINDER FOUNDATION, of Baltimore, Maryland, sent
out requests for all types of material to be judged by them for quality and awarded
accordingly.

Well, wouldnt you know it, we came up with a first. Jesse B. Pierce and Colley
Abney submitted a musical arrangement of “IT’S CHRISTMAS TIME” and wow!
Mr. Fred E. Weisgal, the ‘Prisoner Award Committee Chairman’ was most lavish in his
letter to the two men for their contribution, and to prove that his praise was fact he
enclosed his check.

We sincerely hope that, “IT’S CHRISTMAS TIME” reaches the pinnacle of suc-
cess, not only is it just a piece of good work, but it carries a message to all: That men
under the pressures of serving time can still make time serve them.

Congrats, fellows, and may you have success in all your future endeavors.

Let’s hope that next year’s winners are as modest as these two were. They thought
Echo, had slept a bit, but we always find out the good news.
