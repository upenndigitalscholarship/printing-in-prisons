From the Superintendent's Desk:

The following is a portion of a speech delivered by Mr. Banmiller before
the Penna. Prison Society on May 5, 1958.

Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes and his father, Dr. Holmes, both had a keen aware-
ness of human frailty which made them question conventional concepts of moral re-
sponsibility. They showed a profound understanding and pity for the wrongdoings of
others. They realized men are often the unfortunate victims of forces beyond their con-
trol and consequently need compassion and benevolence. |s that so strange?

An examination of 608 consecutive admissions to Sing Sing in 1916 showed that
59% were found to be mentally diseased, feebleminded or otherwise mentally ab-
normal, having a close relation to their anti-social behavior. At Eastern during the peri-
od 1931-4] one out of every 42 felons was mentally disordered to a committable degree
or developed such a condition. These were documented prior to the last arrest. Sum-
mary. reflection leads to the disquieting realization that the court over-looked and the
offender was given no help to prevent further serious crime. We must realize and pro-
vide for greater psychiatric and psychological help in prisons as you can see. We at the
institution know this only too well.

On all sides we hear the cry that the increase in crime is due to our “soft” attitude
toward the criminal. Bear in mind that the usual compelling motivations of normal life
are lacking in prison routine. The constructive energy of the individual is dissipated.
The result is the hardening of the prisoner and the belief held by him almost ineradi-
cably that society’s fist is permanently raised against him. Judge John Briggs, Chief
Judge of our Third Circuit Court of Appeals remarks: “| have known many laymen and
some judges who seem to believe that they have been cheated if the convicts do not suf-
fer in prison. It is as if one of the rewards of leading a good life was the added equity of
assurance of pain and suffering for the wicked. Such persons entertain the earnest and
sincere belief that improvement in prison conditions is a coddling of the wicked and un-
regenerate, that convicts must be made to suffer bitterly so that they must realize their
evil doing, as one man said, “If they smell hell, it will do them good.”

Witness the great difficulty encountered in procuring work when a prisoner has
served his time. You would be amazed at the intransigent attitude which the respect-
able citizen takes toward the person in prison for crime. It is in effect additional pun-
ishment which is senseless and far removed from the admonition of Jesus of Nazareth,
“Let him without sin cast the first stone.”
