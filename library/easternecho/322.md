What are YOU going to DO about IT?

by BINFORD H. SMITH

It was timely then. It is timely now.

Warden Perey A. Lainson’s article, ‘‘What Are
You Going To Do About It?’’—which appeared in
THE PRESIDIO, a penal publication, in September 1956,
is the subject of protracted timeliness, which is here
rehashed in part.

Governor Leo A. Hoegh of the state of Iowa, in
response to a preview of the article, returned the
following commentative reply:

“I wish there were some way whereby every
American citizen would be exposed to the siguificance
of Warden Lainson’s article. Here in few para-
graphs is the story of the American prison, the Amert-
can prisoner, and the American society which has filled
our jails and prisons throughout the nation. Here 1s
the challenge laid down to the American citizenry by
one of America’s outstanding prison officials. This
should be required reading—not only for office holders
and politicians but for every American citizen with
a stake in today and tomorrow.’’

Well, what are you going to do about it?

Most folks assume that social status is an ac-
eurate index of need, ability, and usefulness; and
this—elass prejudice—is one of the most serious ob-
stacles to social progress. This attitude is reflected
in the neglected problems of crime and punishment
throughout the nation.

Warden Lainson refers to "... an item
buried far back in most newspapers reporting that
185,069 people were confined in American prisons
in 1955... (The information was released by James
V. Bennett, director of the federal Bureau of Prisons,
who noted it was a one and seven-tenths per cent in-
crease over the previous year.) ’’

What does it mean to you? As Warden Lainson
pointed out, “It means, in the round kind of dollar
figures that usually impress people, that it costs
American taxpayers 200 million dollars each year
to keep those men and women securely locked away
in their prisons. That figure doesn’t mean the
enormous cost of detecting criminals and convicting
them—it means 200 million dollars just for keeping
them in prison for one year.’’

Do the above figures sound all out of propor-
tion? But not less astounding, is the public’s com-
placency. We know, however, that when the citizenry
becomes aware of the enormity of this social problem
much more progress will be made in this area.

Veteran Warden Lainson asserts, crime cannot be
corrected by mere imprisonment le am, sume
that every warden in the United States who has been
observing criminal activities over a period of years,
will agree with me in saying that this crime situation
can be corrected. It can’t be corrected by imprison-
ment, not in this prison or any other prison. It
must be corrected in the spawning places of erime,
in the communities (all communities) from which
the criminals come. Very little crime is started in
our prisons, despite misleading headlines.”

Under the keen acumen of Warden Lainson let
us view the problem from yet another front:

“The battle that must sooner or later be won
if we are not to become literally a criminal-minded
nation must be fought on ethical grounds, not with
prisons or clubs or electric chairs. And that’s the
part I believe too many people fail to understand.
All of us are prone to violate this law and that
one; committing small, apparently inconsequential
‘‘erimes’’ almost without thought. But such actions,
simply because we don’t pay any attention to them,
are deadly little straws in the wind.’’

The problems of crime and punishment are
not the responsibility of official agencies alone; by
virtue of our American way of life, such social prob-
lems demand the efforts of every responsible citizen.
A very illustrative paragraph from Warden Iainson’s
article sums it up:

‘‘A start could be made tomorrow—or even yet
today. If you and your neighbors would start show-
ing an interest in your courts and prosecuting
attorneys and police departments and parole boards
and prisons, it wouldn’t be long before more progress
would be made in fighting crime. If you will pay
more attention to your schools and churches and
communities—if you will start thinking about and
looking for the “‘little’’ things in everyday life—
even more progress will be made in the battle. It
is not enough to leave the job of law enforcement and
crime prevention to official agencies. That is the
way it has been done for years, and look at the way
crime keeps increasing. Instead of electing them
or reading of their appointments and then forgetting
them, every person who thinks of himself as a law-
abiding citizen should show interest in their work
and in their problems. Our criminal codes need to
be changed. There’s hardly an agency that I know
of which doesn’t need at least some improvement.
In many cases vast improvement is needed, through
overhauling of all the processes of law enforcement.
But nothing at all will be accomplished if the average
citizen continues to be completely indifferent.

“We talk and sometimes rave about foreign
nations keeping many people in penal camps, and we
get very indignant about unjust treatment of people
all over the world. All over the world, that is,
except right here mie our land"

What are YOU going to do about it?
