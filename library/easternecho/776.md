Penal Exchange Notes

The Echo Staff wishes to thank all the Institutions
for sending us their Penal Magazines. In the future
we hope to. satisfy them the way they have satisfied
us. With this edition we have made space, so that we
may show our thanks to the fine writers of the penal
press. Due to shortage in space, we may only be al-
lowed to thank so many in every edition. Keep up
the good work fellows.

a fine magazine and a good name, and you are doing
a very good job on the magazine, we look forward to
your poems.
