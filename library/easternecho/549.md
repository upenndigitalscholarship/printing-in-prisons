Editorial:

With this, our fourth anniversary issue, we are presenting the first of a series of
commentaries, each of which will be devoted to a specific area of criminology or penol-
ogy. We have chosen to introduce our new format with a discussion of commutation
because of its paramount importance to prisoners as a means toward freedom, and its
timely news value as a subject of public interest.

Our change in format with its inclusion of writers other than inmates is the natural
result of our growth and experience, which brought with it more appreciation of the
fact that although the issues of penology and criminology revolve about the criminal
and prisoner, any changes for the betterment of the same must be essentially
effected by outsiders. By offering for discussion the opinions of those who by their
authority or position control our destinies as prisoners, we open the door for the further
participation of the general public, without which we can accomplish nothing.

In our exchanges with other members of the penal press, we have seen both the
“institutional rags” devoted to Christmas menus and the local ball club, and the “gripe
sheets” dedicated to the proposition that society is wrong in all things and that all
prisoners are angels. Neither one accomplishes a worthwhile purpose. The first earns
the approval of the authorities and the displeasure of the inmates. The latter pleases
the inmates and antagonizes the officials. Their biggest failure lies in the fact that
they both leave the outside reader cold. They offer nothing of value or interest to the
average John Doe, the man upon whom we must depend in the final analysis for any
correction of the evils which at present beset both the inmates of our prisons, and
derivatively, free society.

By the presentation of a well-rounded coverage, including pros and cons from
prisoners and free writers, we feel we may better stir public interest and opinion.
Parochial viewpoints can only endanger our cause — to regain society's respect as
individuals by demonstration of the fact that we are capable of thinking and acting
in a rational manner.

Whatever changes are made in our format, our basic purpose remains as always
the desire to better the inmates’ lot by bringing knowledge to the public. A public
largely misinformed concerning any area of penology. If by so doing we contribute
in any way to the welfare of our readers, wherever they may be, we shall feel
rewarded. Your appreciation is cur bread, your approval our salt. We will attempt
to rate the same at all times.

James "Mike ” Smith
