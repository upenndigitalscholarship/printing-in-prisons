DOT SCHEER
HONORED

by WILLIAM CRESSMAN

Dorothy W. Scheer

A friend to those
in need of friendship.

Twenty-thousand prison inmates paid honor
by proxy to a Philadelphia woman the night of
January 21st in the auditorium at Eastern State
Penitentiary when ECHO proclaimed Dot Scheer Mrs.
Public Relations of the Penal Press.

ECHO was joined by some 30 other penal press
publications—representing prisoners from this coun-
try, Canada and Latin America—in paying tribute
to Dot Scheer, a woman who works tirelessly in
behalf of prison inmates everywhere.

A persistent letter writer, an unflaggine con-
tacter of people, Dot works away at her self-appointed
task of winning friends for prisoners, now in touch
with a broadcaster, now an editor, or perhaps even
an official of the United Nations; so impressing them
with her sincerity and deep faith in the goodness
of men everywhere that she is constantly widening
and lengthening an avenue of understanding be-
tween prison inmates and the general public.

A very warm and human person, filled to the
brim with love and compassion for all peoples, Dot’s
life could well be a lodestar for others to follow.
Her cheery outlook on life with all its complexities,
her deep and abiding faith that there is good in
all men if one only seek it out, her ever-poised
typewriter ready at a moments notice to take up
our cause, all these testify to the rightness of ECHO’s
presentation to her of the scroll proclaiming her
Mrs. Public Relations of the Penal Press.

I don’t know Dot’s religion—she may be Catho-
lic, Hindu or agnostic—but I do know that the life
she lives is the life all good people should be proud
to live: a life of service to others, which, as Dot
herself would admit, is constantly enriched because
she is repaid manyfold in satisfaction for what she
does for others.

A heart big enough to embrace all humanity,
single-spaced letters full of ideas and hints about
a wide range of subjects, a cheery, openhanded smile
which says ‘‘I’m your friend:’’ these are some of
the images which come to mind when I think of
Dot Scheer.

She is more than these, though, as a mother
is more than the dictionary definition, ‘‘a female
parent.’’

She is acceptance when there is none.

She is understanding where it is lacking.

She is a friend, with all that this word implies.

Who is there who has not, more than ever before,
welcomed a sunsplashed morning when the night
was long and dark and cold?

What friendless prisoner, bound within the shell
of distrust and misunderstanding and fear, what
prisoner does not doubly welcome an open hand and
a cheery smile when it is proffered to him, freely?

I am happy that ECHO played a part in giving
at least a small measure of recognition to a woman
who so richly deserves it.
