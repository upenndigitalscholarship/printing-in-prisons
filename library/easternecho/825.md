From
the
Superintendent's
Desk

On Saturday mornings it is quite interesting to stop off in the staff
room and see the Chess Group during their weekly “meditations.” The
sober faces, quietness, concentration, intenseness of purpose, anticipa-
tion, and leisure time pleasure is evident among all the participants.
Possibly many of these men will never play chess once they leave the
institution. Nevertheless, they have found a worthwhile activity to
take up a lot of their time while they are here.

You too can find some worthwhile activity in which you may en-
gage and which may have a beneficial carry-over into your after-insti-
tution life. You may not be interested in chess, but certainly there is
some part of the program that will appeal to you. Many men have
found new interests that not only helps them to do time but also helps
them develop a different attitude towards their future life on the street.
