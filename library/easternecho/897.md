From
the
Superintendent's
Desk

The impossible can happen... After the debaucle that happened to the
“poor ole Yankees’ it is possible that you might make a commutation or a
parole in the next year. This last World Series proves that anything is possible.

However, the Dodgers didn’t get where they are by standing around and
talking about it. They built from the ground up, assembled all of their talent
into a well knit unit and presented themselves to the world as “Champions.”
They were not satisfied with second best.

You too, cannot be satisfied with second best. When you present your
record to the board, you have to be a champion, with all of the blue chips show-
ing in your favor. It is your time at bat and you cannot afford to strike out.

People who help themselves usually find someone who is willing to lend
them a hand. Start pulling yourself up from last place and present yourself to
the board as the new champ.
