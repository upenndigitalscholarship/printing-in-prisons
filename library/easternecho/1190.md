Volume 1, No. 1 ? ? ? ?

After ten years in the womb, the Eastern Echo
has at last been born! This is the ‘‘feeling”
of the present editor and his staff. Consequent-
ly Vol. 1, No. 1, indicates “here we are’’ as
opposed to ten years of pre-natal Echo “‘pres-
ence.” CAUTION: Echo Baby may at times
be a little damp!
