The Reward of Faith

By Rabbi Dr. Victor Solomon

Many people I know are brazenly mercenary to-
wards G-d. They look upon faith as some kind of
glorified slot machine; you insert a good deed and
out pops the reward. For charity, you get good
health and for prayer, peace of mind.

We can certainly blame our shamelessly material-
istic society. Who can ignore the ideology of the
“What-did-you-do-for-me-lately’’ school, which is
the uncrowned monarch of the market, the home,
and the parlor?

The real culprit however, resides in a stunted and
immature religious development of most people to-
day. We look upon religion as a crutch, an aid, a dis-
penser of psychological palliatives and socio-politi-
cal necessities.

The sages of the Talmud were not experts on
rockets and missiles; but they did know that the re-
ward for a good deed is another good deed. And
what is the reward of faith?—More faith!
