SOCIAL MATCHES

During the Summer months only two sociai
matches were played. One against Post #396 (ESP-
7, #396-6) and one against the University of Penna.
(U. P.-6, ESP-2).

The Post #396 match was highlighted by the
presence of Michael Hailparn, 1964 U. S. Champion,
who lost to Martin Pearson of ESP.

The game, with brief notes, is given below.

KING’S INDIAN DEFENSE

White’s failure to play P-QR4 on his 10th move,
to prevent Black’s P-QN4, was the deciding factor in
this game. During Post Mortems Hailparn stated
that he thought P-QN4 would cost Black a pawn. He
counted on 10 ..... P-QN4 ; 11. PxP ; 12. NxP, and
thought that Black would be forced to trade Queens.
However, he overlooked 12 .... RxN when White
would be forced to surrender two pieces for the
Rook. After this failure, White was so disturbed
that he overlooked defensive moves which could
have prolonged the game. Regardless of any other
possibilities, his game was lost.

CHAMPIONSHIP SECTION

Six teams have entered this section and will play
a double round robin. Noticeably absent is last year’s
Champions, Franklin Mercantile, who declined to
enter teams because no one would accept responsibil-
ity for running the teams.

ESP got off to a bad start, losing to the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania by a 314 to 1% score. R. Cantor,
J.. Benton and R. Lunenfeld scored points for Penn
over K. Thornton, R. Thomas and J. Antoniewicz.
L. Massey scored a win for ESP over G. Rader. K.
LeBow of Penn drew with M. Pearson.

RESERVE SECTION

The Reserve Team began the season with a tre-
mendous victory, upsetting Marple-Newton 3-2. M-N
and Bucks County were considered to be the. teams
most likely to win the Reserve title. Eleven teams
are in this section and ESP must now be considered
a strong contender for the title.

F. Camarota and L. Teplitsky, both Experts,
notehed victories for M-N over T. Williams and J.
Ryder. H. Mitchell, F. Jordan and A. White scored
points for ESP over M. Rea, EH. Renatti and P.
Holland.

Following are games of two of the newest mem-
bers of the Reserve Team.
