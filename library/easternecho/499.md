It’s wiser being good than bad;
It’s safer being meek than fierce.
lt’s fitter being sane than mad.
My own hope is, a sun will pierce
The thickest cloud earth ever stretched;

That, after Last, returned the First,
Though a wide compass round be fetched,
That what began best, acn’t end worst,
Nor what God blessed once, prove accurst.
—Robert Browning (After a visit to a Paris morgue)
