Big Words
by Charles C. Clark

If you care to elucidate, then see old wordy John.
The man of many words who misses the meaning of some.
He uses constant conversation, but very little tact.
His words cut you down like sugar cane, or binds you like
a book.
But when ignorance claims its ‘Victor Fair! It’s John who
has been took.
