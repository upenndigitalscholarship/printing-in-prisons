BOOZE NEWS

On January 22, 1966, the United States
Court of Appeals in the Fourth Circuit declared
that “the State cannot stamp an unpretending
alcoholic as a criminal if his drunken public dis-
play is involuntary as the result of disease.”

Two months later, the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia held that chronic alco-
holies may not be punished or Jailed as criminals
for being drunk in public, although they may be
ordered to undergo medical treatment.
