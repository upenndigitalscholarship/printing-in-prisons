CAGE ONE

An editorial

Housed in E.S.P. proper is a population of 782 human beings. In the terminology
of some people, perhaps that should read 782 convicts, with convicts understood as a
breed apart. But more and more outsiders are graciously refusing to draw the line
where God has not. The title of Kenyon Scudder’s book is “Prisoners Are People”.
Prisoners are people. Prisoners are human beings.

What does it take to qualify as a member of the human race. Ability to reason?
That we have. Sentiments of love, concern, compassion, even patriotism? You would
be surprised. Need for love in return, for communication with others, for something
to hope for, work for, live for? Perhaps we are in need as much as anybody.

Imprisonment as punishment does not change human beings into anything else
but people. Isolation from society and BY society. Ah, that is something else again.
Let people deny a dog comradeship and reject him from the community - he becomes
wild. A man, a group of men, if they are cast out, rejected into a place of exile - they
may not look wild, run wild, act wild, as with the dog, but inside they are frantic and
even wild for the contact and communion with the rest of the human family. If each
one does not have someone who cares, to reach through the barriers of his exile and
touch him as a person, he must find that human companionship among his fellow exiles.
No society composed of exiles rejected by the human family can be normal. All pen-
ologists and sociologists warn against the subtle and devastating influence the prisoner
community must bear upon those who are completely isolated within it. They call it
a demoralizing, hopeless influence, scarring the prisoner who is later released back into
society. Scarring him so that he ... cannot rejoin society. Setting him truly apart
from the human family.

Therefore, if you are an outsider who knows a prisoner... write to him. If he
would like you to visit him... visit him. Take an interest in the general conditions,
problems and welfare of the prisoners housed in the penitentiary nearest you. Find out
5 for yourself that they are human beings, like you, with needs, like yours. Examine for
yourself the system, the complicated, sometimes heartlessly mechanical system under
which they live and breathe, from under which each one tries to emerge ... as whole
as possible.

Citizen interest in prisons and the prisoner can make prisons and the prisoner ...
better. Lack of citizen interest can permit prisons to deteriorate and force the pris-
oner to shift for himself, tinding a set of values among his own exiled kind. A set of
values which has also been ... exiled by society.

Sincerely yours,

Robert H. Heinemann
