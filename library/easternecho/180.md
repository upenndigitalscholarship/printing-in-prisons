 I FOUND IT

By Jesse Burch

Many friends ago and many years too late, I
found it.
I found it in the strength of a firm handshake,
I found it in the tender tears upon a motherâ€™s
cheek,
I found it in the warmth of a smile,
I found it in the gentle words of encouragement,
I found it-in the absolution of my priest,
I found it in my bible,
I found it in all the many ways I once knew
... "What?" ... you may ask ... FORGIVE-
NESS" ... say I.
