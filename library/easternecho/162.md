EASTERN ECHO
ANNIVERSARY

by John L. Williams Jr.

With this edition EASTERN ECHO celebrates
its first birthday. A year ago when I was requested
to be a member of and assist in organizing the
EASTERN ECHO, I was enthused but at the same
time a little reluctant to send this infant out into
the cruel world of both institution and free society.
My chief misgivings were based upon the facts that
I did not believe it could compete with established
and professionally turned out magazines in the
Penal Press, such as PRESIDIO, AGENDA, and
others; and I definitely doubted that it would be ac-
cepted by the inmates themselves.

Like any other project in its infancy of con-
struction, the EASTERN ECHO has had its
‘‘clamoration’’ of hardships comprised of belittle-
ment, detrimental domination, esoteric interference,
incompatibility, loggerheads and cabalistic machi-
nations. However, it soon became securely settled
upon a matrix which will withstand practically any
type of difficulties which may confront it. As of
now, under the newly appointed Warden, I can con-
ceive of no such happenings as were previously dis-
played.

EASTERN ECHO has been the recipient, during
its first year, of both favorable and unfavorable
comments. Nevertheless, it is a grateful debtor
to every single one of its readers and writers and
this month it lights in their honor the lonely candle
on the EASTERN ECHO cake.

During this past year I somehow or other have
been able to fill a page or two in each quarterly issue
which has been an unorthodox page, wandering
over various kinds of subjects, and treating them in
all kinds of ways. I, like most other writers who
sign up for a regular deadline, sometimes feel a
twinge of panic. My greatest fear is that some day
I’ll sit down at my typewriter to meet an HASTHERN
ECHO deadline—and nothing will happen. Even
now, I make no promises in regards to my future
writing. I realize that it is almost a disgrace not
to have a view at a moment’s notice on any subject,
but I must admit to a much larger caliber of dis-
grace because it could happen that maybe one of
these days this space will be headlined, ‘‘I Can’t
Think Of Anything To Write About’’.

At this point, I imagine that there will be the
same old few inmate critics who will not hestitate
to flout and fume such statements as: ‘‘You can
always write about the food conditions’’, or ‘‘Why
don’t you write about the judge who gave me a
raw deal?’’, or ‘‘Why don’t you write about letting
us go home at nights’’ and many, many other desti-
tute expectations that some inmates possess. I wish
to clarify that the EASTERN ECHO Editors and
Staff writers have no intention, even for lack of
ready thoughts or material, of printing unilateral
complaints which possess the capacity to stultify
the growth of the magazine. If there is a legitimate
‘‘beef’’ to write about which will benefit part of or
the whole inmate group, the Staff members will not
forebear presenting the facts—but in a manner
conducive to understanding. There is a demand
for reckless originality of thoughts and a demand
for theory and even unsound philosophy rather than
none at all, but they must be said with a rare com-
mon sense and a conscientious regard for veracity
which would preserve them from flippancy or ex-
travaganee in writing.

In order to receive recognition, we, the inmates,
must prove to society that we are not the type of
Tasmanian devils as the newspapers, more often
than not, describe us to be. When we write on any
particular subject we must do so by looking at the
situation in an objective way (as the Editor pointed
out in our December issue), which will be more ap-
preciated and recognized than if we would revert to
name-calling like many politicians do at election
time. Under no circumstances does this mean the
EASTERN ECHO is an institutional magazine. It
is somewhat restricted but to a small degree, and
not enough to be considered detrimental to its voice.

When you hear that the EASTERN ECHO, or
any other penal publication, is written for and by
the inmates, some of you misconstrue its actual
meaning. This magazine, as well as others in the
Penal Press, is not intended for intellectual ‘‘beefs’’.

In retrospect to our initial publication, and
eliminating all personal feelings and beliefs, I must
concede to the fact that the first Hditor of EAST-
ERN ECHO formulated exceptionally good policies
by which all future members were to be governed
and abide by. We have tried to the best of our
ability to follow these policies. Like a new-born
child, KASTERN ECHO will need help and guidance
in continuing to abide by these policies until it is
sufficiently matured to the extent that its potenti-
alities will be unlimited.

We, the Editors and Staff, intrinsically have
your, the inmates’ interest at heart, and are en-
deavoring to ascertain any and all possible ways
and methods of helping you. Help us to strongly
mature and it won’t be long before EASTERN
ECHO will be producing fruitful benevolences for
the inmates on a whole. If you want EASTERN
ECHO to be a voice strong enough to help you, then 
you in turn must continue to support and help us
to do so Without your assistance and cooperation
we could do nothing for you.
