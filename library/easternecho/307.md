FOOTBALL REVIEW
by HANK MYERS 

CARDS AND RELIABLE A.C.
BATTLE TO SCORELESS TIE

The heavyweights waged war at mid field throughout
the length of this one. Both teams equally strong across
the line with the Cardinals showing perhaps a slight edge in
backfield strength. Quarterback Billy Hallowell handled his
squad well and got the very most out of them, This reporter
felt he did a fine job in keeping his teams unscored-on record
intact.

Quarterback Tobin fed the ball with a ‘pro’ touch but
the big line of Reliable prevented his carriers from moving
the skin to any great depth.

Big Joe Wheatly came out of retirement, playing great
both at offensive full-back and defensive middle-line backer.

Knock-Knock, bringing along his helper, Tony Ferrara,
made his seasonal debut in the line. Tony did a good job
at half-back for Reliable.

This was strictly a defensive game as the score indi-
cates. A loud clamor was heard from the sidelines when
in the green of Reliable, Arthur Davis trotted out to take
position at defensive guard, a good sport Big Lou always
a favorite with everyone except his opponents. As the
man said, ‘‘You can’t go over or around him and being as
you can’t go under him, then just don’t go near him.’’

RELIABLE LINE-UP: Billy Hallowell, Tony Ferrara, Al
Kemp, Nick Lazario, Blackie, Zeitz, Joe Cuff, Jack Long,
George Fox, Whitey, Knock-Knock, Hank and Curley. SUB-
STITUTES: Joe Charlanza, Joe Wheatley, Joe Antoniewicz.
CARD LINE-UP: Tuffy, (Mgr.), Locke, Brickhouse, Iron-
Man Dave, Pee-Wee, Hill Billy, Keith, Wells, Drake, Levi,
Adderly, Gaylord, Yancy, Pal, Billy Holmes, Shep.

BEARS BEAT BISONS 12—6

Lightweights, Bears and Bisons tied into each other in
this one in a display of speed and all-round sharp football.

Clubs about evenly matched, the capitolization on breaks
told the tale.

In the first quarter on third down the Bisons were pena-
lized 10 yards deep in their own territory. On the following
play a bad pass from center to Turk, The Toe, standing be-
hind his own goal line, was blocked and recovered by Joe
Antoniewicz to give the Bears a 6-point margin, the extra
point try failing. In the closing minutes of the second
quarter the passing attack of B. Hallowell pushed deep into
Bison ground. A 20-yard jump pass from quarterback Billy
to glue-fingered Socrates Cantoral who stepped over for the
second touchdown, making it 12—0.

The final quarter the Bisons finally showed their teeth
and the latent talent that just hadn’t been clicking

Bear Halfback, Nick Lazario, who had shown terrific
running power as a ball carrier and a blocker, attempted to
befuddle the opponents with a short pass which was inter-
cepted by Tobin and carried inside the Bears 10 yard line.

Two running attempts by the Bisons netted them less
than a yard. On third down Powell, out of a single-wing,
took the ball around right end and over for a score, bowling
over and literally carrying and dripping Bear tacklers. The
extra-point fizzled and the game went into the records
12—6, Bears.

BEARS LINE-UP: Billy (Burke) Hallowell, Nick Lazario,
Harry Zeitz, Al Kemp, Joe Antoniewicz, Socrates Cantoral,
Richie Richardson, Bob Lee, Bill Muller, Charlie Gindle, Joe
Charlanza, Wild Man Young.

BISON LINE-UP: Powell, Mack, Tobin, Turk, Juice,
Drake, Yancy, Agnew, Derry, Payne, Slapp, Pencil Willie,
Louis, Hill-Billy.

CARDINALS SET BACK BY RELIABLE 6—0

Again the big boys put on a terrific display of power.
The lines of both elubs big and strong, however, Reliable
bulls were the faster, particularly on defense. Curley Heath,
240 pounds of drive, looked like part of the Redbirds back-
field, smashing through the line at center and giving Cardinal
backs nightmares. It was his pouring through the line fol-
lowed by line-backer Paul Neal that blocked a fourth down
quick-kick by Turk, The Toe, which wobbled over the Cardi-
nal goal line to be recovered by Curley to net the only score
of the game.

Coming out for first appearances this season wearing the
Yellow-Gold of the Redbirds. Keith at defensive end, John
Gilmore as line-backer, and Dave Crockett shooting bullets
from quarterback.

Cardinals threatened three times, opportunity indeed was
knocking and the power runs of Adderly put the Red-Birds
inside Reliables 10 yard line. Hanging on in the proverbial
last ditch stand the Reliables dug in and held off what ap-
peared to be the end of their unblemished record.

EDITOR’S NOTE: Heard frequently from the spectators
was the comment, ‘‘These big teams really battle and yet
the first argument or poor sportsmanship or dirty playing
has yet to be born!! This is indeed a tribute any group of
athletes would be justly pround of.

CARDINAL LINE-UP: Dave Crockett, John Gilmore, Char-
lie Adderly, Powell, Drake, Tobin, Big Dave, Keith, Brick-
House, Naylor, Locke, Zeke, Tampa Red, Hill-Billy, Pee-Wee.
RELIABLE A. C. LINE-UP: O’Brien, Billy (Burke) Hallo-
well, Curley Heath, George Fox, Jack Long, Whitey, Joe An-
toniewicz, Joe Charlanza, Hank Myers, Knock-Knock,
Blackie, Lee, Zeitz, Nails, Nick Lazario.

TANKS ALL-STARS WIN 7—0

Two All-Star teams, lightweights chosen by Hank, (the
Tank) Myers, (yours truly), and Benny, wound up the grid
season with a classic.

Trying to spot the stars in this one would be impossible.
They all starred. And I mean that literally.

Billy (Burke) Hallowell, as usual, stole the show with
a 70-yard quick-kick return to pay dirt, reversing his field
from in front of a swarm of on-rushing tacklers, he picked
up sufficient blocking to go all the way.

Muscle man, Felix Capone, powered the ball straight up
the center and over for the extra point.
TANKS ALL-STARS: Felix Capone, Zeitz, Billy Hallowell,
Al Kemp, Charlanza, Wet Back, Bobbie Lee, Billy Muller,
Young, Irish Cullen, Billy Wright, Hill Billy, Powell, Skip,
Buffalo.
BENNY’S ALL-STARS: Harry (Juice) Cohen, Nick La-
zario, Drake, Rob Watson, Robert McNair, Billy Holmes,
Richard Diggs, Turkine, Joe Antoniewicz, Pee Wee, Pencil
Willy, Richardson, Yancy, Billy Essen, Norman.
