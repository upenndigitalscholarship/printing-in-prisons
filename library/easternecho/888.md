HANDBALL

Of late there has been great enthusi-
asm shot into the game of handball with
the appearance of one, Paul Barringer,
who proposes his games as being the
best —-barring none. This has created
quite a stir among some of the better
players, such as Ed Parks, Frank
“Smitty” Smith, John Walker, Leonard
Massey, ‘Moose’ Holloman, Sam
Brown and Charlie Whiteside. They
are all ready, willing and able to take
on this “Demon” Barringer anytime.
Sam “Blase’’ Jordan has stated he fears
none of the above on the court and is
ready to prove it to them. As a team
Ed Parks & “Smitty” state: They fear
no competition whatsoever from any-
one in the institution. We'll play any
and all competitors that may doubt us
as being the greatest since the Atomic
Bomb. This is what we two really are
—Bombs. Come one, come all, feel
the wraths of Parks & Smitty. It is a
known fact that before the long hot
summer is over many of these same
voices will be silenced when tourna-
ment time arrives.
