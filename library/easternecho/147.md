ALL-STAR GAME
by STEVE POLTORAK

CHERRY HILL, July 28—The National League
standing on the first base line, the American League
on the third base line, a star spangled Flag on the
pitchers mound, banners and pennants fluttering.
The band playing the Star Spangled Banner with
Yancey vocalizing. All adds up to a World Series
atmosphere.

Warden William J. Banmiller, over the loud-
speaker, saying, ‘‘We hope to have a better ball field
here next year by removing a building, but, I am
sorry to say, we cannot remove the wall that runs
down the first base line, as some of the boys sug-
gested. I will now throw out the ball and hope you
have a good ball game. May the better team win.”’

The visiting Nationals, quickly showing they
are up for this one, jump out to a 1-0 lead in the
first inning on Scully’s clutch double. The game
then develops into a brilliant, tense pitching duel
between Jordon and Kalvidis. Sparkplug Billy
Hollowell covers the infield with an acre of hustle.
In the action-filled 5th inning, ‘‘Nails’’ nails a home
run, putting the Nationals out in front 2-0. Henry,
the next batter, steps up to the plate. Then follows
what must be the managerial gem of the year.
Manager Knock-Knock walks up and tells Henry
something. Henry nods, swings at the first pitch,
and hits a towering home run. In the last half
of the 5th inning, pinch hitter Levi, proving that all
the Americans are not swinging rubber bats, slams
out a home run, but this is the American’s last
gasp, and only run scored. Nationals win the
game 3-l.

Exceptionally good umpiring, the orchestra
tooling melodies and the play-by-play announcing,
all helped to make the game a little something
special.
