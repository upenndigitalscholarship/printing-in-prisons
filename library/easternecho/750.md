SCIENCE

by
Henry Sliva

Tell me not in terms of logic
Wisdom brings but good to all,
When this wide world over science
Strives about to bring man’s fall;
Stealing Nature’s strongest forces
Handing these to frightened men,
When was proof more great that genius
And insanity are kin?
On whose side are men of genius
With the Prince of Peace or Mars?
Now that question begs no answer,
Strolling through the world’s bazaar’s;
Scarce as Saints are men of science—
Seen as Churchmen, teachers, or—
Humble traders raising barriers
To restrain the rush to war.
Better far if men of genius
Learned the Sermon on the Mount;
Not the awesome power in atoms
On which politicians count—
Holding them like some strong counters,
So to bluff their opposites—
Who hold cards at conference tables,
and half their wits!
Strong as theirs—and half their wits!
