Eastern Chess Review
by
Norman Harman

The second year of Philadelphia Chess Association League
competition opened for our Club on October 15th when American
Legion Post #396 Reserves invaded the ESP Chess Club to chal-
lenge our Reserves. ESP was victorious as Darrah, Norman and
Rade scored wins over Walsh, Monteleone and Hansen. Quinn
lost to Tomlinson while Harman drew with Porter.

On October 30th, the Reserve Team of Germantown ‘‘Y’’
visited the institution and went away the victors as Raich beat
Quinn, Parberry won over Norman; and Harman blundered on
his 19th move and was defeated by F. Seidel. Darrah and Rade
scored wins over Clarkson and Hoffman.

On November 15th the Championship Section Team of ESP
saw action against Marple-Newton. This match produced a
stand-off as Pearson and Arkless battled to a draw; Brawner
and Hallowell scored points over G. Harman and C. Murter;
Paschedag and Williams dropped decisions to E. Kelly and T.
Kelly.

During the interlude between league matches we were visited
by Smith, Kline and French Laboratory, E. F. Houghton & Co.,
and the Greater Northeast Chess Clubs, for social matches. In
the SK&F match of October 13th, Ray Thompson, James Jack-
son, Thomas Goodfellow, Charles White and Alfred Hewitt won
from Ronald Richter, Howard Freedman, Dr. Ralph Pollikoff,
Gene Jackson and Joseph Coogan. In the remaining game on
this card, William ‘‘ Horse’’ Diggs had to settle for a draw with
Fred Hickler.

Scanning the score of the E. F. Houghton & Co. match,
October 23rd, we found F. Jackson, J. Jackson, T. Goodfellow,
C. White and J. Poster scored points for ESP over C. Prucker,
R. Reiff, R. Williams, J. Kirk and P. Ferguson. M. Epstein
suffered ESP’s only loss, being defeated by F. Walsh.

Checking the match of November 6th, we find ESP scoring 4
wins and 1 draw over the Greater Northeast Club, with two
games being adjourned and are to be finished at a later date.
The winners for ESP were N. Harman, J. Jackson, R. Thompson
and C. White. Al Rade drew with W. Cockhill. GNE losers
were J. Johnson, R. Reiff, J. Sciuto and J. Kirk.

In this issue we introduce two more members of the ESP
Chess Club’s Championship Team. Thomas Williams is the only
player who remained in A Class after being promoted from B
Class. He had a record of two wins, one draw and four losses
in League competition, One of Tommy’s games was published
in Chess Review. In club tournaments he hag finished second
four times, one of these being in the 1959-60 Championship
Tournament; finished third twice, was fifth on two occasions,
has had two ties for sixth place, one being in the 1958-59 Cham-
pionship Tournament. In addition to these he has finished in
ninth place on one occasion. For us to evaluate Tommy’s game
we only need to look at the following:

William K. Hallowell started the league season playing on
the Reserve Team where he had a record of one win and two
losses; he was promoted to the Championship Team and won
three games and lost two. Hallowell’s erratic games have en-
abled him to finish in second place twice; tie for second place
on two occasions; finish third three times, one being in the
1959-60 Championship Tournament and tied for third in the
1958-59 Championship Tournament. In addition he has placed
fourth on two occasions and has tied for fourth once. Two
