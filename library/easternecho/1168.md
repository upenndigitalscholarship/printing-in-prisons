FLASH! The Falcons take the first half as was
more or less expected of them after their high-flying
start. Congratulations are in order to “G.I.’’ Joe
McNeair and his proud, hustling Falcons, who
literally devoured the rest of the league.

The Dodgers, Mustangs, and Braves, have
served notice they’ll be after the Falcons “for real,”
in the second half. All of which should keep them
scrambling to maintain their lofty perch.
