THEMES
and
VARIATIONS

by Selvian R. Chandler

In any production there must be considerable
time and effort put forth to come forth with a worth-
while piece of goods that will be worthy of those
who will view it as well as those who will participate
in it. For certainly it stands to reason that nothing
thrown together in a haphazard manner can be ex-
pected to be smooth running and interwoven into
an over-all, well-balanced and easily functioning
unit. Time, effort and a certain amount of balance
must be put together in such a manner as to bring
forth the essence of what is being done by a group
producing and putting on a show.

It is therefore thought by this reporter, and all
that I have had occasion to converse with, that the
last Variety Show presented for the entertainment
of the men was a success in every aspect of the word.
To use the words of others—‘‘Better than any
they’ve put on yet,’’ ‘‘Best I’ve seen since I’ve been
here," and other similiar remarks, all crediting
the performers with doing a fine job. As this goes
to press prior to Christmas, I should like to identify
the show being spoken of as the one presented on
November 20th and 21st, last. I may truly say that
I think the men who took part in the show did a
wonderful job and more will be said of them later,
but for the moment I should like to give credit to
those who arranged, prepared and staged the entire
production. They did a job that was both necessary
and important in making the whole works ‘‘tick”
into a well-meshed, orderly group. To them, then,
do we say, ‘‘Thank you for your time and effort to
make this a good show.”

The curtain rose as the orchestra swung into
“Hey’’, their theme song, with Joe Fatio leading
and making the introduction of the show and the
Master of Ceremonies, ‘‘Marty’’. Marty in top hat,
tails, morning trousers and carrying an ivory headed
cane in his white-gloved hands, majestically appear-
ed on stage doing a broadway medley consisting of
‘‘Yankee-Doodle Dandy’’, ‘‘Give My Regards to
Broadway’’ and ‘‘Mary’’. In his attire he was quite
elegant and made a striking picture of an exclusive
club M. C. and, he is in an exclusive club. No pun
intended.

Next the orchestra with two numbers, perform-
ed ‘‘Baby Don’t Tell on Me”’ and, with Al Larue as
solo Altoist, rendered a fine ‘‘Harlem Nocturne’’.
Sessions danced to ‘‘Exactly Like You’’ and was
well received by the audience. Which, I might add,
is a rather critical audience. Next, ‘‘Little Snooks’’
accompanied by the orchestra gave a nice interpre-
tation of ‘‘The Sand and The Sea’’. His appearance
was very warmly applauded.

In every show there is an act that is a show
stopper or it may be called the one that took the
show. This then was my impression of Henry and
Phillip’s dancing a tap routine to ‘‘Tea for Two’’.
These are two of the guys in, shall I say, the middle
age group, who one probably wouldn’t think of as
being able to do such an act. Yet, these two guys
really had something. Their timing and coordina-
tion was superb and their dance was something to see
and appreciate. By the applause of the audience,
and I mentioned before of their being critical, it
indicated that these cats had really given them a
solid send. The roar of appreciation was actually
deafening. These two old troupers deserved every
bit of it.

‘‘Foots’’ next swung on stage doing his own
styling of ‘‘Take Me Back, Baby.’’ With his vocal
versatility and foot work, it was good.

Several times I’ve mentioned that an act or
actor came on stage or swung on stage. Well, this
cat, Dupree, flipped on and fell all over the stage.
Doing a “‘flash dance’’ to the tune of ‘‘Dance of the
Gremlins’’ he whaled in that sporty costume of his.
To say his act was funny is an understatement; it
was hilarious. Clean and good.

The orchestra with Al Raski as baritone soloist
took us on a ‘‘Cook’s Tour’’ then gave us a ‘‘Lemon
Drop’’ to progress the grove. Finally, though far
from being the least, ‘‘Foots’’ and his ‘‘Dragons’’,
a vocal quintet, came on with some very fine selec-
tions in the modern vocal trend. And they ended
with ‘‘Little Snooks’’ backed up by the quintet and
Lockhart on guitar, rendering the final number.

That then was the show. All that was left was
the orchestra and the show cast singing the audience
out with ‘‘Free Hats’’. It reportedly was enjoyed
by everyone that saw it. This includes the person-
nel as well as the men who live here. The men who
participated enjoyed doing so, for they are one of
us and it was for our enjoyment.

It is the intention of the Music Department to
present such shows as these as often as it is possible
to do so. I only hope they will be partially as
good as this one was, then no doubt the merits of
this show will be clearly recognized. This is not
to say I don’t want to see a show just as good as this
one. Not in the least. It is only to say that it will
take some doing to top it. As for me, I should like
to see every show that is presented accepted and ap-
preciated by all parties concerned. May they all
be, as the show of November 20th and 21st was.
