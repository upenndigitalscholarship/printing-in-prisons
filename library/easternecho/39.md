REHABILITATION OR REVENGE ?
by HARRY W. JOHNSON

IT MAY BE TRUE that the weed of crime bears
bitter fruit, but the question is, ‘‘Who, or what ad-
verse elements of society, first sow the seeds respon-
sible for the growth of the weed?’’

The motive, as defined by law, for any act of
crime, is only superficial and in substance is as vola-
tile as a puff of smoke rising heavenward, and too
often does it conceal the real cause for crime which
lies concealed somewhere in the depths of the mind;
and by no scratching of the surface can it ever be
discovered and its true nature defined.

Past modes of punishment actually accomplished
none of the things for which they were first set
forth, which was to instill in the heart of the offend-
er such a fear of punishment that it would serve as a
deterrent to future criminal activities and perhaps
lead him to a possible path of rehabilitation.

The idea of punishment was a system of revenge
by which society got even with the criminal, but such
a system is not necessary with many of our offenders
today, for they do have an awakened conscience and
punish themselves with a far greater severity than
could the law.

The system of today is supposed to be based on
a program of therapy and rehabilitation by which,
through analysis and corrective treatment, the of-
fender may be purged of all criminal tendencies and
provided with the instruments necessary for the
moral and emotional growth of his integrity and his
probable rehabilitation.

But after he has been successfully purged of all
criminal tendencies and does stand as a proven mod-
el of penitence and reformation, what happens when
he makes an appeal for clemency before a board
whose decisions are supposed to be shaped and
weighed on the scale of justice tempered with
mercy ?

He presents a meritorious plea for clemency be-
fore the Board of Pardons, but there are those who
make haste to scourge him with the whip-lash of re-
venge by writing malicious editorials in the news-
papers and resurrecting the crime he committed....
perhaps ten or fifteen years in the past....so that
public opinion might be stirred to prejudice and
clamor for further incarceration and revenge.

He is again placed on trial by these editorials,
is found guilty by a jury of citizens en-masse, who
do not care to know the rehabilitated person he now
is; but because of what he was in the past he is again
sentenced to a cruel and unjust term of penal-servi-
tude and remains a living expiatory sacrifice for
those who must have someone to punish for the
erimes of the many who never get caught, but who
remain concealed behind a cleverly woven veil of
moral platitudes.

These malcontents who show a flagrant disre-
gard for the administration of any justice tempered
with mercy do not. know the great harm they do
when they write such editorials, for the offender
involved could very well receive an irreparable
psychological wound and retreat into a shell of
bitterness, where he becomes enervated, thoroughly
unproductive and withers away into shameful
obscurity.

Because he had never been properly educated
in the fundamentals of good conduct, proper respect
for the laws that govern our society, and responsi-
bility to his fellow man, he was truly a pitiable
creature who had not learned to understand him-
self, nor how to best utilize his God given talents
for the benefit of all.

No matter who he is, or whatever the nature of
his crime, he commands respect for his dignity as a
human being. What he was he cannot, nor wil]
not, deny; but he also knows that he is a changed
human being, and although he is ostracized from
society, he wishes to be understood and treated as
such. Humane treatment, in many cases, rather
than attacks on his integrity, may surely help to
further humanize this unfortunate.

If we are to follow through with a scien-
tifically planned program of therapy and rehabili-
tation, which the authorities here are endeavoring
to do, I believe it should be done with the support
of, rather than opposition from, the press and
radio, for if this support is lacking the program
may fail and become as impotent as the gilded
statue of charity would be in a poverty-stricken
village of emaciated derelicts and blind beggars.
