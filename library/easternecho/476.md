The Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia is one of the two great
historic prisons of the world, the cther being at Auburn, New York. The latter
has been completely rebuilt while Eastern remains almost intact except for
additional cell-blocks having been added.

The original structure cost $775,000.

The site had been a cherry orchard on a slight elevation from which it
derives the often used nameâ€”Cherry Hill.
