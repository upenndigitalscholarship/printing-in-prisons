TWO TRIALS — ONE CRIME
from THE SPECTATOR

In a majority decision handed down recently by the United States Supreme Court, that court ruled that a defendant who has been acquitted in federal court may be tried on similar charges in the state courts.

In a 17-page opinion, Justics Felix Frankfurter declared that federal exoneration is no immunity from state prosecuton for the same crime.

Justice Hugo Black, one of the dissenting voters, expressed a profound fear that the practice of double trials is "now likely to become commonplace."

Although there is a clear-cut distinction between the state and federal courts, we wonder if one trial for one crime isn't more just and ethical.

The fact that recent ruling will allow either the state or federal government to pick up the case and prosecute after one or the other court has acted, would seem to indicate that the person, whom ever he may be, couldn't possibly be guaranteed a fair and speedy trial.

Wouldn't this also give the "waiting" court a chance to weed out the first courts weaker points and thus build a stronger, tried case against the defendant.
