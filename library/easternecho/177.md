AS I SEE THEM
by Steve Poltorak

BASEBALL PREDICTIONS

Although wintry February winds are shaking
the window frame with icy fingers, a real baseball
fan can only hear the electrifying roar of a crowd
ata ball game. The sudden snap of an icicle break-
ing is magically transformed to the sharp crack of
bat meeting ball, and the white substance covering
the ground is not snow but a white carpet provided
by nature to herald the approach of the coming base-
ball season.

Once again, it is time to try to look into the
future. Although trades, or a great year by some
obscure veterans; or the meteoric rise of some
rookies; or the new no-wind-up delivery so vividly
portrayed by Larsen’s perfect game and Turley’s
brilliant pitching in the world series, may change
the baseball picture drastically, it is still fun to
make predictions and add fuel to the hot stove
league. Some of the fuel will probably come from
the limb I am out on, but here are my predictions:

AMERICAN LEAGUE

1st—-NEW YORK: Hatching in the evil dome of
Casey Stengel are nefarious schemes for the down-
fall of the rest of the American league. Mantle and
Berra will be the hatchet-men.

2nd—BOSTON: Boston has six letters, heaven has
six letters, Red Sox has six letters and second has
six letters, so its Boston for second place; besides,
this is the team I follow.

3rd—CHICAGO: With Senor Lopez at the helm
they have a smart, fast-running club. It is rumored
that Nellie Fox will increase his chew to two hanks
of tobacco. Remember when he slipped his chaw
into Rizzuto’s glove, thereby creating a soggy
surprise ?

4th—DETROIT: Kaline, Kuenn, Lary and Bolling
are growing tigers and will see Detroit in the first
division. Detroit fans appear to be going about
their everyday, casual living, but in reality they are
using their magical powers to move ahead of Boston.

5th—CLEVELAND: The retirement of Bob Feller
is symbolic. Too many Indians are growing old at
the same time and too few papooses are coming up.
Looks like a long summer for the tribe.

6th—BALTIMORE: Paul Richards has a steadily
improving club. A real headache team: going no-
where, but giving all other clubs a headache along
the way.

7th—WASHINGTON: Chuck Dressen will keep the
Senators out of the cellar even though he has poor
material and a poor club. If all the hot dogs sold in
Griffith Stadium were laid end to end, they could
declare a Bolognus Carta.

8th— KANSAS CITY: Lou Boudreau is a hustling,
seething type of manager, but he does not have the
patience and tolerance needed to re-build a big
league team.

NATIONAL LEAGUE

1st—MILWAUKEE: The faithful fans of Milwau-
kee will finally be rewarded with a pennant.

ODE

‘‘The Reds are tough, but I have a hunch
the Braves will beat them to the lunch.’’

2nd—CINCINNATI: Birdie Tebbett’s muscle men
will come close. This club is like a dinosaur—a lot
of power, but not enough defense, or pitching. Who
ever heard of a dinosaur pitching? Anyhow?

3rd—BROOKLYN: Robinson has retired and we
hear that a flock of vultures are sitting in the roof
of Ebbets Field waiting for Pee Wee Reese, Roy
Campanella and Carl Furillo to topple. Night games
will be billed, ‘‘ Vultures in the Night.’’

4th—ST. LOUIS: The Cardinals are on the wing
again; they will climb up from the abysmal depths
and win a place in the sun. Sad Sam Jones will
pitch with the new no-wind-up delivery and will
have a good year.

5th—PITTSBURGH: The surge of the Pirates in
the first half of last season amazed the baseball
world and served notice that they are no longer
pushovers for anyone.

6th—PHILADELPHIA: The Phils are rebuilding,
expanding their farm system and adding more scouts.
This is the only sure way to rebuild, but it is slow.
Meanwhile, they may show up in the Kentucky
Derby.

7th—NEW YORK: Sad times have befallen the
Giants. We predict that a quantity of hot dogs and
peanuts will be sold in the stands.

8th—CHICAGO: The Cubs will finish in the Na-
tional League. Someone has to be last and its the
nature of the Cubs to trail after the bigger bears.
