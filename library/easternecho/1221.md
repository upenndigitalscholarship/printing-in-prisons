INNOCENCE

Please there Your Honor, didn’t know that gal was
so young,
Why Mister Honor Sir, thought she was all of 21...
All dolled up such as she was and astanding so tall,
It was really her that was for having the ball.
That’s truth Honor Sir the truth, may the earth
swallow—
What now!, What’s that rumbling and sounding so
hollow?
Oh lordy-lordy Your Honor Sir please,
Just look here how I’m a-shaking my knees.
Little girl! Little girl!, tell the Honor the truth!
“Da-da, da-da, dada forsooth!”
