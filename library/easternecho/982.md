nally gave up trying to learn the harmonica . . . You can’t talk and play at the same

clarinet . . . Everyone is beginning to call him Benny Goodman . . . He just blows and
blows ... and don’t bother a soul ... Big Sam has seven months to go... and he is cram-
ming every minute he can get on the linotype machine . . . so he can get a half decent

like May 30th . . . Overheard in the yard .. . I don’t think the officer’s barbers work
very hard .. . everyone that goes in there . . . is bald . . . Maybe they do wax jobs too
Johnson’s Glow-Coat of course . . . Ever since Blackie O’Lock received his diploma from

found when he was marking numbers in the old men’s clothes on 9 Block . . . Old Red
said it was an accident... The Third toughest guy in Gloucester, New Jersey . . Charlie
Negri... boasting that he never strikes out in a ball game... fanned four times...
when King NONO... was pitching... heh... heh... An oversight from last issue of
the Echo... we mentioned Lou McCloud being a barber... roofer... office clerk...
etc... the editorial department has just learned that he is also a plumber and as you
know... there are very few good looking plumbers around . . . including Lou. . . I still
don’t know why Flip Flemming buys 3 and 4 tubes of Brylcreme .. . He should hit the
officer's barber shop for a Simonize job... Whenever Frank Ellsworth laces his shoes
... he’s going to court... again... I just recently watched the process of making a
dental plate in the dental lab... man... those cats know what they’‘re doing . . . deli-
cate and precise down to the tiniest measurement . .. Cantoral and Jim explained the
operations to me... while Archey and John Grandy tried to talk me into going to the
dentist to have a few filled . .. They don’t call me Fang for nothing ... you know...
Delehanty works in the Print Shop Morgue . . . in fact he looks like a morgue attendant
... sometimes I think maybe he’s dead .. . and nobody has told him... APPLE POLISH-

ment’s Dept .. . and congratulations to Mr. Berg in the Educational Dept . . . and to
