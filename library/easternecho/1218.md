THE BURGLAR

While sitting in a tavern sipping a beer,
Slug decided he had nothing to fear,
From robbing a store known as Gimble’s,
Where are sold such valuables as 10¢ thimbles.

Standing in the alley in the bright moonlight,
Slug never wavered from the imposing sight,
Of the department store and all its wealth;
Loot for the taking through his cunning stealth.

He sealed the wall like a hopped up eat,
Reaching the fire escape he layed down flat,
And told himself he was goddamn slick,
That this building he would easily lick.

From atop the roof he viewed the street,
Look at Slug, with the city at his feet.
The bottle on his hip was his courage and reason,
His armour against the chance of treason.

Slug seen a window, opened up wide,
Pulled himself up and dropped inside.
Burglary sure is easy it sure is a snap,
Those jerks who work are full of crap...

The papers next morning carried the story,
Of the watchman finding Slug, crushed and gory.
It seems old Slug had made a speedy trip,
Down an elevator shaft—into death’s grip.
