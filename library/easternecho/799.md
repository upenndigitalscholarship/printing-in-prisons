the concrete bedroom

seven weary paces in length....seven feet wide....twelve feet high ...one bed....
springless..iron..dreams are made here....one skylight window that looks up into
eternity....this is where you take your scotch vacations..you know..you lay there
and let your mind wander..and wander it does.. this is where you live..live..exist
is a better word....this is where you exist most of the days..months..years
sentence....your future is determined here....if you have a future....ninety-nine
years is not a future..... regardless of what you may have heard or thought......
this is where the next hold-up is planned....not all are released with shining halos
....prominently displayed....or you plan a new and better life for yourself...
try to plan it that way............ lights out at ten p.m.....zero hour to let the curtain
down....true feelings emerge in the fri¢éndly darkness of your concrete bedroom
..no holding back now..its dark..you are alone..remote..cut-off as one of the
major planets gliding in orbit....you lay on your bed..no one to fool but yourself
......you take a deep breath...its dark..no interruptions..only the flashlight every
twenty minutes......an unwanted intrusion..to disorganize your train of thought..
sometimes it startles you as you lay there and the flash beam penetrates the soft
darkness....as if the guard could see what you have been thinking..you lay there
another day gone..you mumble..how many have passed..how many to go....you
lay there....arms outstretched....palms up....fingers curled slightly as though in
an attempt at some bewildered appeal to mercy....mercy....do i want a crutch to
lean on....sympathy....a father confessor....this is when you become conscious of
a tightness around the heart ....the empty feeling.... you find yourself abruptly ....
agonizingly....aware of your time....your element.. the problems facing you........
yet....so far away....jees i should write a letter..wonder why i havent heard from 
joe and mary....what can i write to them....having a fine time....wish you were
here....some joke....flashlight searching for me again....must be ten-thirty....cant
sleep....not sleepy..never in bed before twelve outside....jees i want out of here..
....i want out real bad....had enough of this....two years in now....money....better
start saving a few bucks....money....wonder if anyone ever heisted that small
town bank....five thousand would put me right in shape....easy street....pull the
thing myself....get a rod from old mike....job has to be cased....need money for
the nut....expenses....room rent....have to eat....maybe i can get a job....who
who would give me a job....need a job and sponsor for parole....maybe i can
connect for a good job....dont want to come back here....maybe things will go
good for me....wouldnt need the smalltown jug....dont want to do anything to
make a pinch....better get a job... getting old....half decent job....wouldnt need
the old gang....stay by myself... nice-clothes..maybe a little car....not too old to
meet a nice girl....yeah....settle down....tell her about myself first....probably
drop me like a hot potato....parole board....have to get out first....parole board
not letting too many loose....tough board....my record is good....except for the
fight..and the coffee in my cell....dont know why i think like this...always the
same thoughts....every night....confusing....two years in..eight to go....must be
getting late... guard shift changing....its quiet now....very quiet....snow is coming
down hard....getting cold....twenty-fourth of november....twenty-fourth....jees
thanksgiving....for these gifts o lord..i am thankful....turkey....family dinner....
togetherness....more blessed to give....come....please come....blessed sleep.......
