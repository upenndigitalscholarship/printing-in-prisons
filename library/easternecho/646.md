STOREHOUSE LEAGUE

With the pennant race well under way the league
shapes up as a three-team race with the Rockets about out
of it. In first place, the Lynx enjoy a 5 game lead over
the nearest rival, the Cardinals, who are close-pressed by
the Phillies. The Lynx started the season with the (over)
confidence of the defending champions of 1959. However,
the Cardinals, who have awesome power, can’t seem to
acquire the pitching they need to go with their hitting power.
The third-place Phillies have power and pitching but can’t
get the two working together. In last place, the Rockets
tailed to get off the launching pad. In the next issue we’il
run down the entire league in detail.
