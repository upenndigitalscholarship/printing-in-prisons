THANATOPIS

He tossed himself out the window. From a window on the twenty-third
floor. The smog caused him to sneeze the very moment he was airborne.
Jack had been contemplating for some time if death was final or not. His
decision, to find out.

Somewhere between the ninth and eighth floors Jack came to wonder if
this fall-out was necessary. What if there is no style of living or aware-
ness of self but this one of being alive on earth, he thought. . . in an
absolute death, he would not recognize the finality.

As the second floor swished by, his brow was wrinkled in doubt, and it
appeared as if he was about to say, WHOA!.. . but as he greeted the
pavement he said nothing more than, UGH!

Bob
