THE TERRIBLE THING

“Many men upon their release carry prison about with them into the air, and hide it
as a secret disgrace in their hearts, and at length like poor, poisoned things, creep into
some hole and die. It is wretched that they should have to do so, and it’s wrong, terribly
wrong, of society that it should force them to do so. Society takes upon itself the right
to inflict appalling punishment on the individual, but it also has the supreme voice of
shallowness, and fails to realize what it has done. When the man’s punishment Is over,
it leaves him to himself: that is to say, it abandons him at the very moment its highest
duty toward him begins. It really is ashamed of its own action, and shuns those whom it
has punished, as people shun a creditor whose debt they cannot pay, or one on whom
they have inflicted an irreparable wrong. | can claim on my side, that if | realize what
it has inflicted on me....there should be no bitterness or hatred on either side. The
terrible thing about prison is not that it breaks hearts—hearts that were not made
to be broken...but that it turns one’s heart to stone.” — Oscar Wilde
