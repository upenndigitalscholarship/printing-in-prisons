Penal Press Reviews
by RALPH TEITJEN

FLA-CO-LO

Welcome to the Penal Press fold. Received
your first issue and can offer nothing but the high-
est praise. You introduced yourselves in a very
capable and appealing manner, it was unique and
creative. Your art was the best we have yet come
across. It showed that a great amount of work and
patience was put into all your illustrations. The
coloring and symmetry leave nothing to be desired.
It gives the rest of us something on which to set
our sights.

Your make-up, art, articles and stories, and
your poetry rate the congratulations of the entire
Penal Press. Each item was superbly written, illus-
trated, and told a remarkable story. It was impos-
sible to pick out the best story or article.

I suggest that you incorporate in your Policy
the aim of all Penal Press Publications Speak FOR
the inmate, not TO the inmate. Slant all your arti-
cles to the outside audience. Let each piece tell a
story. Do not preach to the Inmate. Present their
problems, and if possible a solution. Express their
views, their dreams and ambitions. Have as much
Inmate created material as humanly possible.

The entire staff of the EASTERN ECHO wel-
come you to our midst and congratulate each of you
for a really true and great new Penal Press Publi-
cation, FLA-CO-LO.

NOTE TO ALL PENAL PRESS EDITORS: Make
it a point to add the FLA-CO-LO to your exchange.
It’s a GREAT PUBLICATION and CAN’T MISS.

ADDRESS: Editor, FLA-CO-LO, Florida Correc-
tional Institution, Lowell, Florida.

THE TERRESCOPE

Your Summer 1958 Issue was well rounded out.
Your articles carried a lot of punch and were pow-
erful. Sketches of outstanding Inmates—Terry
Hooters—are fine and drawings very good. Inmate
writers are doing a great job. Your Editorial
“Across the Editor’s Desk”, should be read by all,
for it is so true. We congratulate your entire staff
for a great issue.

THE PRESIDIO

Wonderful story on the “HOUSE OF FORGOT-
TEN CHILDREN,” in your July Issue. It should
make your audience sit up and take notice. Let’s
hope it will awaken society to the fate of innocent
children. Your photo’s could have been better fo-
cused and pictures clearer. Noticed you had four
outside contributors in this issue. Why so many?
Do you have trouble obtaining inmate created ma-
terial? I would like to see a feature page de-
voted to inmates, a la “Snoopy” of the EASTERN
ECHO. I believe this would increase inmate interest.
“TIME’S TURNSTILE” by Paul Harris, would be
an ideal spot to feature this suggestion.

THE CORRECTOR

Have noticed in your July 1958, issue of The
Corrector, that you erred in erediting the poem
“The Best and the Worst” to a Dick Emmons. This
piece of poetry is an original by our Jesse Burch,
as published in the EASTERN ECHO, Fall 1957,
Issue.

THE NEW DAY

Very disappointed in your July 12, 1958 Issue.
With a population of 321], you should be able to
come up with some excellent writers and articles.
On your editorial page (2) you feature an article
telling that turpentine, soaps, ete. are by-products
of the pine tree, also of a new mine fire truck that
is on the market. The majority of your items are
reprints credited to other penal press publications.
I believe you have enough writers to give us some
fine articles and feature columns. Your coverage
of inside sports is fine. I hope to see you come
on strong.

A. P. P. DOPESTER

Cartoons are very good. Photography is large
and clear. Your entire sports section was devoted
to outside sports, such as the All Star Football
Game in Chicago, the American and National League
All Star Baseball Game. Why don’t you devote
your sports section to the events within your institu-
tion. There was a lack of articles. In fact, your
July ’58 Issue carried only one article, “It’s No Fix!”
Mr. Fixx—by James E. Hess. You have a great
magazine, don’t let it go down hill.

CALVERT COURIER

Your covers are going over with a big bang.
Well liked and always good for a smile. Good art-
icles, good cartoons, good fiction. Would like to see
more inmate names in your sports and other feat-
ures. Why not try a sort of gossip column?

NOTE: I am inclined to agree with some of our
Penal Press Editors, regarding Penal Press Re-
views. It seems to be a standard practice to pat
one another on the back. lLet’s get away from this
sort of reviewing and have some constructive criti-
cism. In the reviews above I have endeavored to
offer constructive criticism. The EASTERN ECHO,
welcomes your constructive criticism.
