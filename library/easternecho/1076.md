Walter Stepper, photographer for the ECHO and the
institution for over ten years, has gone to considerable
trouble to process our photographs for reproduction on
the offset press, which we now use to print the maga-
zine. Considering the limited facilities at his dispo-
sal, we commend him for his attempts to produce
quality pictures.

Stepper has applied for commutation of sentence
and we understand that his application will come be-
fore the Pardon Board in November. Although we
don’t relish the idea of loosing our ’’clicker’’ man,
we of the magazine staff wish him the best good for-
tune... if his application is granted. Any day now,
Walt, so just keep your hopes up!
