In studying the backgrounds of three hundred inmates of Sing Sing, Dr.
Mary Van Kleeck discovered that unemployment was present, more often
than not, in crimes against property. This category (property crimes) con-
stituted the majority of offenses for which the average inmate of this group
was sentenced. Dr. Van Kleeck, in review, had this comment to make:

“Many individuals who are unemployed and who have similar difficult
conditions to face, have broken laws. On the other hand, it seems evident
that as industrial depression throws men out of work there are always a num-
ber of men on the borderline who cannot resist this last pressure of economic
insecurity. Whatever place we assign to such a condition as unemployment in
its influence upon crime, we can at least be certain that a man’s relation to his
work must have attention by those who would prevent crime or by those who
would restore him to a normal status in the community.”
