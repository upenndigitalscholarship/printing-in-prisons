EVERYWHERE some virtue cherished
or affected, everywhere some decen-
cy of thought and carriage, everywhere
the ensign of man’s ineffectual goodness
-- ah! if I could show you this! If I
could show you these men and women
all the world over, in every stage of
history, under every abuse of error,
under every circumstance of failure,
without hope, still obscurely fighting
the lost fight of virtue, still clinging
to some rag of honor, the poor jewel
of their souls!

——— Robert Louis Stevenson
