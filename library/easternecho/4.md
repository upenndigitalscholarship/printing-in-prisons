From the Warden’s Desk:

One of the first principles a man must learn in business is to get along
with his fellow men, whether he likes them or not. So simple a matter as
friction, between employees, will throw the entire organization out of gear
and result in delays that are costly and unnecessary.

Mr. Arthur T. Prasse, Commissioner of Correction, in his table of opera-
tion to function the same in each of his seven institutions, had uniformity
and simplicity of operation in his mind. The table has clearly defined units,
with delegated authority, for the proper clearing of inmate problems.

Technically speaking, organization is a group of individuals who function
under the direction of a unit leader, who is responsible for the conducting
of a designated routine of duties.

Humanly speaking: the modern organization is nothing more than a
ereat family whose Chief acts as head and whose executives share with him,
in equal interest, the duty of maintaining high ideals, proper prestige, praise-
worthy ethics, and sound business principles.

No organization is greater than the sum total of its leaders and, for this
reason, any individual intrusted with leadership and responsibility who
betrays the confidence of the head of the organization, or its leader, for his
own selfish interests, or his exaggerated ego, is a wastrel of his own powers
and feels that the regulation set-up, in our table of organization, is hampering
his individuality. Unit leaders who feel that they are independent of the
main organization, and that their unit should be under their authority only,
are out of step with the idea of modern organization. There is no excuse for
inmate requests not being channeled thru the proper departments.

I feel extremely proud of the operation of our Medical Department. I
believe it to be the most complete in any of our institutions. In these days
of expensive medical bills I know the inmates join me in singling out this
department and expressing my appreciation of seeing the job they do. The
true tradition of going out to serve is to them a daily job...and how well
they do it ! ! ! !

From organization we drift to management....so important in the lives
of inmates, and yet quite often forgotten by them, the ones who benefit.
Plans are in progress and in operation for the stretching of the budget dollar.
The change over from the old straw mattress to the new ones --- and oh, how
fast Huntingdon delivered them here --- a dairy herd at Graterford, and that
means fresh milk at a greatly reduced price for meal service at our institutions.
Refrigerated trucks, labeled ‘‘Bureau of Correction’’, will be hauling veg-
etables, meat products, milk and fruits from the institutions in the farming
areas. This is management at work. Soon we will have installed a modern
unit for washing mess gear. The system of 100 years is being changed and
modernized. All this aids in good housekeeping. When you have efficient
management, increasing the purchasing power of your budget dollar, why
not give him a helping hand. Keep your house clean, don’t destroy clothing
and above all don’t waste bread. We are doing our best... you do yours.

The other day, while walking through the institution, I talked with a
chap who has spent many years at ESP. I inquired as to his health and he
told me he was taking a test and changing the subject he stated, ‘‘I want
to do something for you, maybe blood, skin, or an eye’’. Where else do you
meet folks like that, especially since I could use all three.

Like the Arab, who folded his tent and in the dead of the night, silently stole away.

So be it with the Colonel. Not good-bye but so long to a grand group.

Frank G. Martin, Warden
