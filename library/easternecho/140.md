COME HOME, ANGEL!
by JOSEPH ROSSELLI

Over these prison walls flew a slender, disheveled
pigeon, skittering to a muddy one-point landing in
the small exercise yard adjoining Hobby Alley.

Her landing gear plainly damaged in the early
morning’s lashing rainstorm, she now huddled for-
lornly against the iron-grille gate like a soul with-
out a friend.

Not quite. ‘‘Get Russ!’’ shouted a member of
the clean-up crew towards the narrow Alley.
“There’s another one-legged Sally out here.’’

In a moment, the stout, ancient door of the end
shop creaked open. Hobby Alley’s tall, genial-
smiling Bill Russell waded across ankle-deep mud
of the yard. With grimy, scarred hands, he gently
gathered up the trembling pigeon.

Back in the Alley Shop with Sally braced in the
warmest corner of Russ’s oblong bench, he swiftly
began trimming wood for splints. Others in the
shop, ‘‘Long-Time’’ Dave Aikens and Billy Wright
had.already started procuring tin tops full of fresh
water along with Weight-Lifting Champ William
Bakey breaking salted peanuts into small bits, a
discovered quick energy restorer.

By the time Sally had stopped shaking like a
leaf and sampled a few beakfuls of food, Russ was
ready to set the broken limb. So expertly moved
his fingers, as Big Bakey held the squirming Sally
firmly, that by the time the noon whistle exhausted
its ear-deafening shriek, Operation Leg Repair
stood completed. Uttering not so much as an ap-
preciative ‘‘coo,’’ Sally greedily resumed feasting on
the remainder of Big Bakey’s delicacies.

Before the hot sun traversed the century-and-a-
quarter old cell-block roofs many more mornings,
Sally would be up and off, flying over the high wall.
Sleek and sassy, she would be remembered as an-
other brief interlude sandwiched between prison
tasks, brightening the grey sickness of bleak
monotony.

Only several months earlier there had been the
Spring visit from Wrong Way Corrigan, the Parra-
keet. Undoubtedly he believed he was flying home-
ward from a neighborly visit in South Philadelphia.
Instead, he landed due West of the Delaware River,
in the Big House.

Besides that, a cool, brown sparrow recuperat-
ing from an injuried shoulder, learned to ‘‘enun-
ciate’? Wrong Way’s spicy phrases. Becoming
close buddies, they shared food together and
followed each other around the Shop. All through
days of convalescence the sharp sparrow mimicked
the Parrakeet’s lingo, causing bellows of laughter
from his benefactors.

Wrong Way proved one of the happiest birds
to be set on the right way home, and was still an-
other pleasant memory these little feathered am-
bassadors had added to Russ, Billy, Dave and
Bakey’s shopful of rich memories acquired during
their combined total of some eighty-eight years in
durance vile.

Starved pigeons and half-blind robins, ailing
songbirds and fallen sparrows—some with crushed
wings, others with broken legs and still others
given up for dead. Yet, with simple aids of sun-
baths, eye washes, wood splints, reclaimed feathers
and doses of codliver oil administered with justice
and tempered with kindness, each was given a new
lease on life. A new contract to fly the width and
breadth of spacious azure blue skies again. This
by four men, three for whom Lady Luck throughout
the reign of half a dozen Governors and Pardon
Boards, continued to roll ace-deuce.

One strange and almost unbelievable opera-
tion performed involved Pigeon MacGregor’s still
talked about pair of wings. MacGregor’s sad
plhght had its discovery on the day marked for
Sally’s bon voyage.

Smoothing Sally’s dark velvety head in parting
farewell, Russ squeezed Sally between the iron
grille separating the Alley from the exercise yard.
He tossed her towards the high noon sun. As she
gained altitude a commotion arose at the lower end
of the north cellblock. Several fellow-prisoners
stood helplessly watching efforts of another pigeon
furiously flapping its wings in a valiant attempt to
fly.

In every community, whether hemmed in by
stalwart city blocks or closeted by stout, iron cages,
there flourishes good and bad seed. There are
thoughtless as well as thoughtful human beings;
and one, whose conduct-rating on a scentometer
would explode its mercury, had maliciously snipped
the pigeon’s wing feathers—every last one.

Hach succeeding effort the gallant pigeon made
to fly ended with a crunching crash against the
ancient stones of the gaunt cell block. Up the
pigeon would go, propelled as if by sheer will power
alone. Then, unable to stay aloft, he came bumping,
slipping, sliding, tumbling to the hard ground.
Gathering himself together, scarcely resting a
moment, but striving to control what remained of
his poor wings, he whirled and tried again... and
again... and still again.

“We oughta put it out of its misery,’’ spoke the
tallest in the group as Russ approached.

‘‘No,’’ said another. ‘‘I’m betting the boys in
the Alley can save this bird.’’

“They couldn’t make a new set of wings!
Nobody e’n, or there’d a been a couple two-legged
jailbirds missing count long before this.’’

‘Trish, this bird sure reminds me of that stub-
born-headed MacGregor. Didn’t they say he’d
never make it? But, he did, didn’t he, Irish?’’

“Yeah, after fifteen years filing writs of
habeas: corpuses.’’ Irish rubbed his chin. ‘‘Sure
an’ it’d be a fittin’ monicker for this game bird
MiacGresOre

While these comments circulated among the
men, Russ had been edging nearer the pigeon.
Closer and closer he cautiously moved, mindful not
to frighten the bird further. As it once more
desperately beat its wings to stay aloft, Russ caught
it just before it would strike the rough corner stones.

Out of the sweat of perseverance and the sweet
sugar of patience, such is the stuff miracles are
made of.

For through long, tedious, trial-and-error hours
spelling into days and weeks, Russ, Billy, Dave and
Big Bakey labored. Discarded feathers gathered
from around brick walks and exercise yard were
carefully accumulated. Pigeon-guests dropping in
for a leisure lunch contributed one if not two plumes.
All underwent a pearl-buyer’s scrutiny, screened
and selected for weight, color and length.

To restore the mutilated wings their uncorked
talent woud have eredited our legendary masters
of ingenuity. Not only had weight and size of
feathers, along with their perfect matching, counted.
But, of utmost importance was the arranging of each
plume so that when MacGregor’s reflexes signaled,
action, every wing feather would spread symmetri-
cally and hold firmly.

Cleaned and serubbed dowel sticks picked for
their fiber sturdiness, Russ sanded and shaped to
micrometer exactness. Quills to be used, Big
Bakey trimmed at the tips just sufficient to insert
bracing sticks that were freshly dipped in glue.
Opening quill-casings on the pigeon’s wings one by
one, Dave wedged in the dowel stick attached with a
redeemed feather. Swiftly Billy sealed off the
incisions with cement, then bandaged and tied each
wing quill securely in place.

And the battle was on... the constant watchful
effort to keep MacGregor from pecking the bandages
loose. From the pained expressions, it seemed to
hurt the men more than the bird to be laced in a
sort of strait-jacket contraption till the glue set.

There were moments when MacGregor’d sit
on Russ’s bullet-maimed arm and, wings drooping,
peer with such wistful longing at the little patch of
blue glimpsed through the narrow window over-
head, plainly saying: ‘‘Please, Friend, won’t I
ever fly again?’’

Finally, when the last bandage had been re-
moved, MacGregor craned and craned his scrawny
neck to admire these new wings. But, the doubtful
gleam in his golden eyes remained, evident for all
to see. Beauty was one thing and flying another.
More than anything else he yearned to fly again.

The Sunday afternoon before commencement of
the season’s terminating baseball game Big Bakey
had suggested as grand take-off day for the gallant
MacGregor.

Oh, he was a pretty handsome fellow, now, as
his four benefactors stood back admiring his strut
deep in left field. Full, grey, ankle-length trousers,
brushed and pressed, enhanced his v-shaped black
cutaway coat. Across light-grey tail and tapering
wingtips, two black ribbon streaks stretched their
distinguishing marks like those adorning royal court
members.

For a suspenseful moment, MacGregor pecked
industriously at stray pebbles, Suddenly, with a
loud flap of powerful wings, up... up he flew!
Then, seemingly twitching his beautiful, fan-spread
plumage in farewell salute, he sailed gracefully
over prison walls.

It is said not even the fall of a tiny sparrow goes
unnoticed, leading to the strong belief that Good
Samaritan acts find recognition Up There.

‘But, down here, if ‘‘ All the world’s a stage,’’.
as Shakespeare eloquently declares in As You Like
It, then along its crowded fringe Russ, Dave, Billy
and Big Bakey—these four rate a generous round of
applause from their fellow actors.
