"What is the intelligent, constructive, sensible thing to do with offenders? ...

"In the long run prisoners know more about this than anyone else, and ought to come up with
the best ideas...

“So I come back to the point that progressive ideas about the control of social offenses and
the wisest handling of offenders for their good and society’s protection are likely to spring from
the constructive thinking of some who have had personal, bitter experience, and who are able to
rise above that experience and devote themselves to the solution of a problem which baffles us all,
and the solving of which will be a magnificent life expression for some of those who have suffered.’’
