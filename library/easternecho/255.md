Humanity is by no means so materialistic as fool-
ish talk is continually asserting it to be. Judging by
what I have learned about men and women, I am
convinced that there is far more in them of ideal-
istic will power than ever comes to the surface. Just
as the water of the streams we see is small in
amount compared to that which flows underground,
so the idealism which becomes visible is small in
amount with what men and women bear locked in
their hearts, unreleased. To unbind what is bound,
to bring the underground waters to the surface:
mankind is waiting and longing for such as can do
that.

â€”ALBERT SCHWEITZER
