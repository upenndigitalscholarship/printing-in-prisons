ARISTOTLE TO ADOLPH TO LBJ

In Mein Kampf Adolph Hitler has shown how he
gains acceptance (pistols and brass knuckles help-
ed, too). Guided by his dominant purpose—to
get his notions across—he urges these simple
rules: (1) Arguments must be directed to the
“Jeast intelligent” of the people; (2) avoid “‘sci-
entific ballast’’ as much as possible; (8) give the
simple points ‘‘thousandfold repitition;’’ (4)
seek ever to hold the attention of the great mas-
ses; (5) seek not ‘‘the many-sidedness of sci-
entific teaching;’’ (6) restate the main few
points as slogans; (7) never try to become ver-
satile, altering the methods, for the masses will
not retain the idea; (8) never permit the faint-
est suggestion that there is ‘‘right on the other
side; (9) no halfway urgings will do; things are
either ‘‘positive or negative, love or hate, right
or wrong, the truth or lie;’’ and (10) regardless
of all else, keep focused on the fundamental prin-
ciple, limit the program, and repeat it eternally.
