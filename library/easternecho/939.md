Who Might
Have 
Been

The port of Men-Who-Might-Have-Been
Lies just off Hasbeenville.
And all the Men-Who-Might-Have-Been
Are shabby, gray, and still.

One missed a punch; one married wrong;
Ambition died in one.
One loved the lights; the lights o’night
That blaze behind the sun.

By gosh! It gives a man a chill
To see them shabby, gray, and still—
So many Men-Who-Might-Have-Been
In the port of Hasbeenville.

The port of Men-Who-Might-Have-Been
Is crowded to the doors.
And all the Men-Who-Might-Have-Been
Are very dreadful bores.

Their tales are old; their tales are dry—
One trusted in a friend;
One lacked the part; one lacked the heart;
To seek the rainbow’s end.

By gosh! It gives a man the mopes
To see them sitting there like dopes—
So many Men-Who-Might-Hayve-Been
In the port of Busted Hopes.

The port of Men-Who-Might-Have-Been
Is east of Used-To-Be.
And all the Men-Who-Might-Have-Been
Are carried passage free.

I’ve seen it pass, their boat of glass
And drift along the years.
With all the Men-Who-Might-Have-Been
Past shoals of bitter sneers.

By gosh! It makes a fellow sigh
To see the good ship Alibi—
With all those Men-Who-Might-Haye-Been
And cargoes of careers.

Damon Runyon
