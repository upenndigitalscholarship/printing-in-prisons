INTRA MUROS
by NORMAN G. HILLIKER

Chess Match with Temple Ends in Draw

If there were ever any doubts about the quality
of chess players within these walls, such doubts were
dissolved as our chess club played host to a form-
idable five-man team representing Temple Univer-
sity.

As our players assembled in the Annex, to await
the arrival of Temple’s team, they appeared tense
and nervous. Perhaps they were apprehensive—
surely a human reaction on such an unprecedented
oceasion. The tension was broken by an exhibition
chess game played by Dr. Morello versus Mr.
Brierly. That "classic?" struggle between Treat-
ment and Custody was one that sponsored a few wide
grins. Unfortunately, the results cannot be reported
because the contest defies description.

With the arrival of the Temple team, the op-
ponents were paired at five chess boards. Introduc-
tions were completed and the room settled into an air
of quiet excitement as play began.

At board number 1 Marty Pearson was opposed
by Jack Stevens, a Math. major and Senior at
Temple. The game continued for three hours, but
after 53 moves Marty was forced to resign and
Temple had a win.

At board number 2 Thomas Brawner gave
Eastern a win with a brilliant trap. His opponent
Harvey Alter, a Junior Math. major at Temple, re-
signed after 11 moves.

Board number 3 featured Mike Quinn versus
Doctor Sidney Axinn, head of the Philosophy De-
partment at Temple. Mike is a guy with plenty of
mileage on a chess board and he proved it in the
game that also decided the match. It was declared
a draw by mutual consent after 36 moves.

At board number 4 William K. Hallowell re-
signed after 19 moves. His opponent was Bill Gins-
berg, a graduate student in Teaching. Ginsberg
taught Hallowell plenty as he posted a win for
Temple.

Board number 5 had Bill Palmer opposed by
Darwin Loigman, a Senior in Temple’s Business
College. Palmer gave Eastern a second win as he
put Loigman out of business with a checkmate in
31 moves.

Midway in the evening an intermission was de-
clared while coffee and cake was served. Mr. Brierly
drew a big laugh as he announced pseudo-sternly,
“If Temple wins they will have trouble at the gate.’’

Although the match was officially a draw—with
each team having two wins, two losses and one
draw—the chess club considers it a solid victory for
pubhie relations and is looking forward to further
competition.

First Chess Tournament Completed.

The initial Class Tournament was held from
March 1 through April 6 with players competing in
each of four divisions. Players were grouped ac-
cording to points compiled after a round-robin play-
off series. Classes A and B each had 5 players. C
class had 17 and D class had 7.

The winners in each class were:

A—Marty Pearson
B—Jack Walker
C—Frank Darrah
D—Milton Clark

A second tournament is now in progress and will
be reported in the next issue.

Release Procedure Clarified

For the information of men who will eventually
be released from Eastern a few questions were asked
regarding funds and clothing furnished to departees.
The answers were supplied by the Staff Board dur-
ing an interview on April 25.

Question: What amount of money is provided
for each inmate upon his release
from this institution ?

Answer: If the man does not have any money
he will be given sufficient funds to
cover the cost of transit to his desti-
nation.

Question : Who determines the amount?

Answer: The Bureau of Correction.

Question: When was the policy last changed?

Answer: The present policy has been in effect
since 1954. The former policy pro-
vided $5.00 for each man released,
with an additional $5.00 if his desti-
nation exceeded 50 miles. It was
not withheld from men who had
saved their prison earnings.

Question: Where does the money come from?

Answer: From the general fund (institution-
al budget).

Question: Is this policy standardized in all
state institutions?

Answer: The policy is standardized.

Question: What is the clothing allowance and
selection ?

Answer: A complete seasonal outfit is pro-
vided for each man. It includes
underwear, socks, shoes, shirt, tie,
suit and topcoat in season. There is
no opportunity for selection by the
individual.
