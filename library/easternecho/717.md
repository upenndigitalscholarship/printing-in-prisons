To our subscribers

Greetings:

With the coming of Spring edition of the Eastern Echo, due
during March, we hope to introduce an entirely new format which will
include new policies and new features plus an improvement in print-
ing.

A new offset press has been ordered which will be installed and
in operation in time to handle this assignment. This, it is hoped will
eliminate many of the mechanical difficulties of the past.

The new Echo will be manned by an entirely new staff which
promises to bring into being fresh points of view. At the same time we
will retain many of the past features which have proven to be of
interest.

We sincerely appreciate the support of our subscribers whose
forbearance has been so severely tested during the past year.

Sincerely yours,

The Echo Staff
