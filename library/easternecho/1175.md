ALL-STAR BASKETBALL TEAM TO SEE ACTION!

Prospects for the coming season are shaping up. The
formation of an-All-Star team to play outside competition
has been completed. Some of the men selected include:
Herb Allen, Joe Massanova, Calvin Milligan. Andrew Lopes,
“Rosy” Minter, Joseph Sinclair, Wade Tucker, “Jake the
Snake” Welty, Jerome Blount, "Biggie" Zachary and
Grant Wright. Let’s all hope the competition is keen,
and the games scheduled frequently. Best wishes to the
“Stars" for a winning season.
