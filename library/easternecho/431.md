PRISON TERMS TOO LONG

“Prison terms are too long and too little is known of the potential moral and
spiritual growth to criminals,” said Rabbi Joshua S. Sperke, of Jackson, Michigan.

The Rabbi is the first Jewish prison chaplain in the State's history, and he is con-
vinced that, in general, lawbreakers are confined in prisons too long either for their
good, or for the good of the community.

“There comes a time in the life of almost every criminal when he has accepted
the maximun amount of treatment that he can absorb. It is then that he should be
released. Imprisonment beyond that crucial period lessens his chances to ever adjust
to life in a free society. He merely becomes bitter and apathetic,” said the Rabbi.
