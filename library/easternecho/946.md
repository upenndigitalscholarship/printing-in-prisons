REQUIEM FOR THE BLUE GIANTS

As far as competition goes the Blue
Giants were loaded (at the beginning of
the season) with some promising ma-
terial in Tampa Red, Pigmeat, Big
Mack, Norman Pearson, and a few
others experienced men to go along
with some fancy-footed rookies. How-
ever, through the maze of disorganiza-
tion came bitter defeat. Die-hards like
Eddie Brooks, Norman and Mack kept
the team’s spirit kindled and the spec-
tators busy with the usual bolt of blar-
ing criticism and heckling. I suppose
last year’s season can be called poor
football. Supposition to the wind and
pen to paper, recalling some exhilarat-
ing moments on our football field, this
guy for a committee of one asserts a
vote of thanks for all those who par-
ticipated in 1963’s football season.
