You are
Thoughts
by Albert B. Crosby

A Godly man once told me, “People
themselves are makers of themselves,”
by virtue of the thoughts which they
choose and encourage; that mind is the
master-weaver, both of the inner gar-
ment of character and the outer gar-
ment of circumstances, and that, as
they may have hitherto woven in ig-
norance and pain they may now weave
in enlightenment and happiness.

We know, do we not, the aphorism,
“As a man thinketh in his heart so is
he,” not only embraces the whole of
man’s being—but is so comprehensive
as to reach out to every condition and
circumstance of his life. A man
(woman) is literally what he thinks;
his character, being the complete sum
of all his thoughts.

As evident, the plant springs from,
and could not be without, the seed, so
every act of man springs from his hid-
den seeds of thought, and could not
have appeared without them.

And in knowing this we gain under-
standing and wisdom. And in this
direction, as in no other, is the law
absolute.

And he that seeks these truths; and
it be opened; for him there is only pa-
tience, practice, and ceaseless oppor-
tunity. Open your minds, examine
your consciences, and look ever on the
Godly things of life.
