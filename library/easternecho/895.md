the editor speaks...

Due to your previous criminal record,
etc..... APPLICATION DENIED

I long ago quit paying attention to “Records.” If I had my way,
when a man came into prison I would tear up his record. I would blot it
out whether it was good or bad and let him start life all over again.

As to three time losers—let me say I don’t give a rap about that, as
I have a fine friend who is a four time loser. He decided to quit sailing
against the wind and travel with it. “I’ve sailed against it long enough
and I know it does not pay,” he said to me one day. On my advice he
went before the Parole Board, made good and became the head of a good
size business.

This typically sharp insight into the fallacies of “Record,” is only
one of the reasons why the former warden of Sing Sing Prison, Lewis E.
Lawes, became one of the greatest penologists of all time.
