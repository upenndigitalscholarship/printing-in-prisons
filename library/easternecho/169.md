The Pioneer Of Prison Reform As Reflected Today

Thomas Mott Osborne

by L. J. Biancone

It is amazing how the passing of time has
brought into focus the development of principles
and ideals of prison reform which had their begin-
ning in another generation. It is also of interest
to note that many present-day liberals and un-
selfish crusaders are but sprouts of seeds of con-
templation sown in another era. Long before the
days of radio headsets, cotton mattresses, television
and newspapers in prison, Thomas Mott Osborne was
tilling the soil, so to speak; ie., paving the way for
the modern prison reform seeping into our major
penitentiaries today. Seeds sown by Osborne have
taken root in men whose decisions and actions af-
fect our own lives daily.

As early as 1905, Osborne began his construc-
tive criticism of the prison system. He labored
under the premise that prisoners are fellow humans
condemned to the human scrap heap and that, if
they were to be salvaged, the receptacles to which
prisoners were confined needed a complete overhaul
from administration to treatment. Maximum se-
curity and hard labor, solitary confinement and bru-
tality, miserable living conditions and poor food,
and last but not least, unconscionable sentences,
ranked high on Osborne’s list of criticism as main
causes of prison failures.

A native of Auburn, N.Y., Thomas Mott Os-
borne attracted much attention in 1913 by going to
jail. That is to say, for voluntarily serving a week
in Auburn Prison. His purpose in doing this was to
make a scientific study of inmate problems rather
than for purely humanitarian results. How much
knowledge he acquired from this brief period of
confinement is difficult to say, but at least we know
he did it for an unselfish purpose, and that it en-
abled him to get a ‘‘jailbirds’”’ eye view. Yor the
record, he served under the alias of Tom Brown and,
it is reported, was treated like any other prisoner.
In this manner, Osborne succeeded in bringing the
prison problem to the attention of the country.

In 1912 Osborne was appointed to a state com-
mission on prison reform. He had an uncanny way
of forming friendly relations with all sorts of people
from all walks of life. Other public-spirited citizens
sought his counsel. Osborne blazed a trail across
the nation that literally pioneered in prison reform.

In discussing Osborne with our Warden, this
writer hinted that he was somewhat amused over
the local press depicting Mr. Banmiller’s appoint-
ment as being popular with the prisoners’ senti-
ments. Actually, Pennsylvania’s entire Penal Sys-
tem, including the appointment of Warden Ban-
miller, who has neither desire for popularity nor
any selfish motivation in his job, is merely a re-
flection of the principles and ideals of Thomas Mott
Osborne and his associates. They have left no
room in modern penology for the egotistic and sel-
fish individual. To unfold this principle, let us
briefly explore some of the characteristic traits of
Osborne.

Osborne’s association with prisoners was not
based upon any abstract scientific principles. He
simply liked people. He believed that by forming
friendly relations with prisoners, reforms could be
accomplished more easily, or perhaps better than
any other way. Osborne established friendly re-
lations with prisoners and introduced a new relation-
ship between prison officials and prisoners by the
development of Mutual Welfare Leagues in three
prisons. These leagues were organizations of in-
mates, sanctioned by the prison authorities, to facili-
tate inmate participation in prison administration.
Quite a twist, we must agree, from the degrading
stool pigeon method. Perhaps, as a result of these
organizations, Osborne helped to establish the pat-
tern we see developing in our own Staff Board.

The most permanent result of Osborne’s own
work has been the establishment of an organization
originally known as the National Penal Information
Society, and later as the Osborne Association. This
organization’s objective was to prepare handbooks
of American prisons, containing true information
regarding conditions, to govern intelligent reform
measures.

Osborne was not a trained student of sociology,
but rather instinctively he pioneered the way for the
prison worker of today. Most of the penal reform
in recent years was inspired by Osborne, and carried
out by individuals associated with him during his
lifetime.

Recent reforms also owe much, not to the
egotistic individuals, but to the work of those who
actually devote their lives to this work. Such as
did Thomas Mott Osborne.
