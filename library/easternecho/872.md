Thx Lxsson 
of thx 
Chaplain's 
Typxwritxr

Rev. Sidney E. Barnes
Protestant Chaplain

Xvxn though my typxwritxr is an old
modxl, it works quitx wxll xxcxpt for
just onx of thx kxys. I havx wishxd
many timxs that it workxd pxrfxctly.
It is trux, of coursx, that thxrx arx 41
kxys that function wxll xnough—but
just onx kxy is out of ordxr and not
working propxrly makxs all thx dif-
fxrxncx.

Now thx point of my txlling you
about this small dxfxct in my typx-
writxr—NOT ALL THX PXOPLX
ARX WORKING PROPXRLY.

You may now bx saying to yoursxlf,
“Wexll, I am only onx pxrson; I won't
makx or brxak thx Church.’ Ah, but
it doxs makx a diffxrxncx! Bxcausx
thx Church, to bx an xffxctivx witnxss
and influxnecx among. mxn nxxds thx
activx concxrn and particpation of
xach and xvxry Church mxmbxr.

Or, considxr this: Thx nxxt timx you
think you arx only onx pxrson and that
your xfforts arx not nxxdxd, rxmxmbxr
my typxwritxr! If you xvxr fxxl that
how you bxhavx and how you livx is no
onx’s businxss but your own, STOP
AND THINK how many xyxs arx on
you—stop and ask yoursxlf: “What
kind of an xxamplx amI to my frixnds
—to my childrxn?” Rxmxmbxr my
typxwritxr and say to yoursxlf: “‘Some-
onx nxxds mx—somxonx nxxds mx
vxry much.
