In the case of Benjamin Gitlow, convicted in 1902 for publishing Communist pamphlets,
New York Supreme Court judges Benjamin Cardozo and Cuthbert Pound said in their
famous dissent:

"Although the defendant may be the worst of men, the rights of the best of men
are secure only as the rights of the vilest and most abhorrent are protected.’’
