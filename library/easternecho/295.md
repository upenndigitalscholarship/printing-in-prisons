CAGE TWO
An Editorial

It has become a passion with countless Americans to condemn almost every aspect of life and
activity. They say that our penal system is either too weak or too strong, that the conflict between
crime and punishment will tear us apart, that there has been corruption in high places, that the rise of
the crime rate and the conduct of our teen-agers is so appalling that no one has any faith left in America.

It is likely that this kind of dissatisfaction and disgust has followed every depression and war and
that it is not necessarily a symptom of deep-seated unrest. But it can become a malignant disease,
engendering feverish rancors and the sour bile of discontent.

Can we prevent this malignant disease? Can we banish the rancors and sour biles. Wecan...
We will... IF... we accept brotherhood as our basis for daily living.

Brotherhood will work if we take time to see what our fellow man looks like, to learn his name, to
discover and understand each other as human beings. We must realize that we have to be more
brotherly to our fellow man and then he'll be more brotherly to us.

The problem of putting brotherhood to work in our daily lives is not a simple one, but we risk losing
the essence of the very thing that we are struggling to win if we fail. We shall not have true
brotherhood until we are banded together in an indivisible fellowship, no man unnoticed or crowded
out.. The real triumph of man will not be recorded until the dignity of every human being is recognized,
until every man-jack of us practices brotherhood in his daily rubs against the coat sleeves of his fellows.

It is time to reaffirm our faith in ourselves. We are going to need self-confidence, not cynical
condemnation, to stand through the coming years. Our faith in ourselves is a bulwark and a fortress
against disaster, and perhaps the only thing that can save us from returning to the dark ages once again.
