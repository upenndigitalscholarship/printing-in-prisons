“Many men upon their release carry prison about with them into the alr,
and hide it as a secret disgrace in their hearts, and at length like poor, poisoned
things, creep into some hole and die. It is wretched that they should have to do
so, and it is wrong, terribly wrong of society that it should force them to do so.
Society takes upon itself the right to inflict appalling punishment on the in-
dividual, but it also has the supreme voice of shallowness, and fails to realize
what it has done. When the man’s punishment is over, it leaves him to himself,
that is to say, it abandons him at the very moment its highest duty to him begins.
It really is ashamed of its own action, and shuns those whom it has punished, as
people shun a creditor whose debt they cannot pay, or one on whom they have
inflicted an irrepairable wrong. I can claim on my side that if I realize what
it has inflicted on me. . . . .there should be no bitterness or hatred on either side.
The terrible thing about prison is not that it breaks hearts. . . . .hearts that,
were not made to be broken. . . . .but that it turns one’s heart to stone.’’
