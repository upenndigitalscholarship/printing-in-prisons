Moral virtue or excellence is closely concerned with pleasure and pain.
It is pleasure that moves us to do what is base and pain that moves us to refrain
from what is noble. And therefore, as Plato says, man needs to be so trained
from his youth as to find pleasure and pain in the right objects. This is what
sound education means.

â€”Aristotle
