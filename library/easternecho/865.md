INSIDE
INFORMATION

Man — the new movie screen and the cameras are really saying some-
thing —- The guys who worked the long hours to have everything ready
did a real good job without too much delay—The electric shop men were
Rudy Dominquez—Joe Massonova—John P. Ryan—Jack O’ Shaughnessy
and Charlie Halpine (transferred to Dallas) Some of the other boys are
Joe Antoniewicz the movie operator—Ronald Thompson and Belisario
Cantoral—Cantoral is in the hospital at this writing but I hear he is as
healthy as a gallon of penicillin—-Now if we can just latch on to some of
the good Cinerama movies—Last issue of the Echo we weren’t too com-
plementary about the operating room over in the hospital—since then
they have had a few changes that have made quite a difference in the over-
all appearance of 3 block—The new plaster and paint job—the installation
of the Absolute Filter and the big Autoclave (sterilizer)— I wonder
what the delay is on the new visiting room ?—They tell me they are waiting
for the sansafrantz beams with the belt-in-the-back—The old visiting room
needs a coat of paint—in fact—two coats wouldn’t hurt it—Have you
noticed that the roaches are getting scarce around the institution ?—well
putting it where it’s at—Sgt. Kellegher the vermin control officer is really
squirting that bug juice in the right direction—With all the construction
going on around the yard—the cleanest place in the yard is the Weight
Court—Kelly and Kalvitis are to be commended for their continued in-
terest and hard work on the court—The iron men are really out in droves
it's a popular spot to work off steam and get the benefits of exercise at the
same time—ONIONS to the guy who stole the bench from behind 9 block
Old men with crutches and canes have no place to sit and rest—A BIG
TIP OF THE HAT to Knock Knock Jowett for repairing the benches and
going sky-high—it would be nice if the $4.00 per week limit would be in-
creased to $5.00 per week and the .15 cents -a-day-men were given a raise
Ah! I always was a dreamer—Tampa Red with a Jack Hammer—greatest
thing since John Henry—l hear Freddie Adams does all the arranging for
the big band in the yard—He has a new number he just finished—it’s a
love song called The Object Of My Affection Is Up At The House Of
Correction—No it’s not true that you need a Blue Cross number to be
transferred to 9 block—H.J.B. is over on 9 block—I don’t know how old
he is but—he wants to know if the new movie screen will handle Tom Mix
movies—He also complains about not hearing any Wayne King records on
the radio—l wonder why Eddie Miller - who lifts weights is called—Belly
The Kid ?—Joe Fatio has the big band popping some foot-stomping tunes
Freddie Adams the sax player brought forth something really rare for this
critical audience—a hand clapping ovation after his solo—First time |
ever saw it happen here—I think it pleased Joe Fatio as much as it did
Freddie Adams—The Echo had a little write-up in the Times-Leader news-
paper from Wilkes-Barre Pa.—Who is Kitty from Dodge City in the
Officer's barber shop ?——Cisco asked me to put that item here-heh, heh,—
If they ever put bananas on the commissary—John Blanton from the Craft
Shop will really do a banana f-l-i-p—I hear they call the Dental Lab the —
Fake Fang Department—Welcome to Big John Giardino the new Sports
Editor—Old Red from 9 block says:Be tolerant with a person who argues
with you—he has a right to his own stupid opinion—Red also tells me
that if you wanted to know if a girl had knock-knees in the old days—you
had to listen—Also-Virus is what people get who can’t spell PENUMONIA
TWENTY-SIX YEARS Served Good Luck Johnny Bowers—Man 26yrs.
Well-until next time I better go to work—until I can find something better
to do—Tony Romano | 30 lbs can lift more weight than big Murph 200lbs.
(Yeah! but he’s been sick) —————————————————— (30)
