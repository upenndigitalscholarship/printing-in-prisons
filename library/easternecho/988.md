The All Star Team has gotten off to a fine
start. Noisey Baker appears to have a firm
grip on his managerial reins. Massanova,
the regular pitcher, is getting good support
from his reliefers; Kalvtis and “C. C.” Clark.
In general, the team has been playing a
“classy” type of Softball, even though it in-
terferes with “Summertime on the Pier.” The
Storehouse league played one (1) outside
team (using the indefatigable Massanova),
and won by a very impressive score.
