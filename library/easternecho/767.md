Announcing 
A Music Correspondence Course
A method of cell study aimed to the beginner for learning
the fundamentals of music and its application.

In response to the many requests for music instrue-
tions, from those inmates who are desirous of learn-
ing as much as possible, but, for various reasons, they
are unable to attend the classes, a music correspon-
dence course can now be obtained. For further infor-
mation, or enrollment, inquire at the music depart-
ment, on 7 Block.

In this course, you will find a series of questions,
along with their answers, that are based solely upon
the fundamentals of music. These studies are espe-
cially prepared for beginners, and are compiled in
such a manner, as to provide a simplified method
through which they can very easily learn what the
basic fundamentals are, and just how they are to be
appled to everything pertaining to music.

While the fundamentals, are those studies that are
the most neglected, they are, by far, the most essen-
tial, and the most important studies that a music
student could possible aequire, for the obvious rea-
son, that they represent the only means through
which every type of music in existence, can be writ-
ten, interpreted, and played. It is also through this
medium, that musicians are able to exchange ideas,
and that every type of musical arrangement, and im-
provisation, is made possible. Just imagine, if you
can, what it would really be like, if, the composers,
and the arrangers, had no standard visible means of
conveying their knowledge and ability to the players,
and the players, likewise, had no standard visible
means of receiving it.

Before these studies begin you will be given a
general description of some of the obstacles and dif-
ficulties that beginners and students create for them-
selves, with the hope that you will benefit from their
mistakes, and will avoid them, if, the right kind of
progress, and the proper development, is desired to
be attained.

Every instructor and teacher of music is aware of,
and will readily acknowledge, that, aside from some
physical disability, the most outstanding reasons for
the large number of failures that occur among the
vast majority of the students and beginners who de-
sire to learn how to play music, can be attributed to
the following important facts. (1.) Most of the stu-
dents and beginners of the present era, are very
fickle, and are unable to convince themselves, that
they need a thorough musical education, before they
will be able to play musie according to the standard
requirements that it demands. (2.) They have no de-
sire to learn how to play music according to those
methods that have been tried, and proven to be cor-
rect; they are looking for shortcuts, secret formulas,
or any system that they can use to eliminate their
need for studying music in the only way that it can
be properly learned. (3.) They display the kind of
reasoning, that is to be expected from a spoiled child;
for they have to be pampered, petted, pacified, ap-
peased, rewarded, and induced, to participate in any
kind of a program that will enable them to acquire
knowledge. (4.) They do not have the determination,
or the desire to achieve anything, if, they have to
work for it; it must be supplied for them, and, as
chronic invalids, they will wait for, and expect to
receive everything, while contributing nothing to-
ward their own advancement. (5.) Their idea of a
musical education, consists of reading fan magazines,
such as, the Downbeat, the Jazz Age, the Metronome,
the Billboard, and ete., and religiously studying and
memorizing every article that they can find on the
activities of the professional entertainers, whom they
idolize, for the purpose of creating the impression,
that they know these entertainers personally, and
from their association with them, they have first-
hand knowledge of the things that they discuss about
the stars; such as, where and when a star was born;
what his opinions of other musicians are; whatever
blemishes he has upon his social record; if, he is
feuding with anyone, why; how do present day mu-
sicians rate with those of the past; if a musician is
dead, where, when, and why he died, ete. All of this
information supplies them with material to argue and
to debate, and in their opinion, it qualifies them to be
looked up to, and to be rated on a par with the enter-
tainers that they rave about, while at the same time,
they are unable to realize, that this information has
nothing to do with musicianship, or their own indi-
vidual ability to play music as it is supposed to be
played. (6.) They say that the standard method of
learning how to play music, is old-fashioned, and ob-
solete, simply because it was in existence before their
time; and for that reason, they are unable to accept
the fact, that the principles of music, like the prin-
ciples of everything else, cannot, and will never be
changed, and as a result of this belief, they do not
have the patience to confine their playing efforts to
their instruction books, which are made up of the
type of exercises that are carefully designed to grad-
ually train their reflexes, and to develop co-ordina-
tion for them, while at the same time, they are learn-
ing how to apply the fundamentals of playing music
to their particular instrument. (7.) In their haste,
and anxiety to play popular songs, and rhythmic
figurations, and imitations of the star performers,
before they are ready, or are even capable of playing
any kind of music, they will repeatedly avoid and
ignore the type of studies and exercises that they
could gain true ability with, and instead, they will
devote all of their time and efforts towards improv-
isations and figurations that are far in advance of
their ability to understand them, or to play them cor-
rectly, and for that reason, they are tremendously
handicapped by the fact that they are unable to cope
with music for what it really is, and as a result of
this, they must depend upon their ears to guide them
in their untrained and extremely limited efforts to
imitate, and to try to play what they think is music.
When these faults are avoided by students and
novices, good musicianship will result sooner than
you think it will, why donâ€™t you try it, and see for
yourself?
