On Monday night, January 19, 1959, the Second
Annual Sportsmen’s Dinner was held here at Cherry
Hill for the benefit of the inmates who participated
in organized sports here in the institution, during
the year of 1958.

The affair, again, was arranged by Thomas H.
Graham, Athletic and Educational Director, and
made possible by Superintendent William J. Ban-
miller and his staff.

During the dinner, the diners momentarily lost
interest in the special fare when the special guests
made their appearance. Pete Byron—prominent
Sports Announcer, Harold Johnson—leading con-
tender for the Light-Heavyweight Boxing Crown,
J.P. “Judge” Stilley—a noted Boxing Judge, Shag
Crawford—National League Umpire, Len Matthews
—up and coming brilliant young Lightweight Fight-
er, Bucko Kilroy—Asst. Coach and Scout for the
Philadelphia Eagles, John Stevens—American Lea-
gue Umpire, and Queney McCall—Boxing Trainer
and former Boxer, were accompanied into the din-
ing-hall by Dr. Michael Morello, Director of Treat-
ment, Mr. Graham and Supt. Banmiller.

The celebrities weaved among the dining-room
tables and were greeted enthusiastically.

After dinner, the Sports Personalities and in-
mates proceeded to the Movie Hall. Here, preceeding
the showing of two sports films, Mr. Graham intro-
duced Pete Byron who, acting as master- of- cere-
monies, introduced the other guests and cited their
achievements in the world of sports. As an added
attraction, Pete proved to be quite a storyteller. He
had the fellows holding their stomachs when he told
a tale about a lady and the Mexican-hairless Chi-
huahua.

John Stevens spoke briefly about odd incidents
that he experienced during his umpiring career.
Buecko Kilroy endeared himself to the inmates by
slipping into the prison vernacular during his tell-
ing of a hilarious Pat and Mike story.

The showing of two sports films brought the
evening’s festivities to a close. The first picture was
a color film of the 1958 World Series. This film had
never been shown in this area prior to this viewing.
The final film highlighted outstanding plays of the
1958 Professional All-Star Basketball game.

Noticeable absent this year, there will be in-
dividual awards presented to outstanding inmate
athletes at the next dinner.

Our thanks go to all of the visiting personalities
and to those who made this event possible. Here’s
to a greater year of sports in 1959. = —THE END
