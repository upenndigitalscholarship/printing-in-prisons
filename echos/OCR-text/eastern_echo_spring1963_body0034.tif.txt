The Sportsmen’s Banquet
with ““The Star Spangled Banner,’’ con-
ducted by Maestro Giacinto Vizoco.
Two rousing selections then followed:
“The Altar of Honor Overture’ and
“The La Gallinella Selection #2.’ It
was an inspiring performance by the
members of the Concert Band.

opened

Mr. Graham, Director of Treatment,
introduced Mr. Pete Byron, M.C. for
the evening, and one of this State’s bet-
ter known sports announcers. Mr. By-
ron always brings goodwill and untold
mirth to our sports functions. His wit-
ticisms brought much laughter from
the inmate audience and the honored
guests.

An added thrill was in store for us
when Pete Byron introduced an up and
coming young fighter named Stanley
*““Kitten’’ Haywood, who told of his be-
coming a fighter while attending Over-
brook High School. He got most of his
experience from sparring with the likes
of Candy McFarland, Sugar Hart, Gil
Turner, Charlie Scott, and Georgie
“Champ” Benton, who was also intro-
duced as a guest speaker.

Another local fighter, Bobby Single-
ton, made his appearance and stated,
“We all are seeking something in life.”

His point was that after ten years in
the ring he was now waiting to get a
shot at the Bantam-weight Title.

Phil Logan of the Phila. Hot Stovers
took a bow, and Harry Diamond, Ben-
ton’s manager, also smiled for the
throng. Baseball was represented by
Henry “‘Shag’’ Crawford, the National
League Umpire.

Dave Zinkoff, traveling manager for
the fabulous ‘“‘Harlem Globe Trotters,”’
spoke of his experiences with them and
the millions of miles he’s traveled all
over the United States and foreign
countries. He’s been around the globe
twice, and traveled in 80 countries, in-
cluding the Soviet Union. He’s been
in Europe 12 times and it’s always a
thrill for him to put these shows on for
the people of the world. “Zink,” as
his associates call him, has made mil-
lions of people happy by his goodwill
tours to many veterans’ hospitals like
Valley Forge, to name just one. His
Harlem Globe Trotters are the great-
est basketballers in the world. A very
fascinating thing he said was that in
Rio de Janeiro, they have a stadium
that holds over one hundred thousand
people. Their national sport is Soccor,
and these people take the game very
seriously. At times they have been
known to manhandle and assault the
officials during these contests. A large
moat had to be constructed between
the playing field and the stands to sep-
arate the fans from the field of play.
This is indeed a very strange thing—
stranger than fiction. Thank you, Mr.
Dave Zinkoff for sharing your travels
with us.

Joe Sweeney, a former fighter and
now president of ““The Veteran’s Box-
ing Association,” proved to be an in-
teresting speaker because his memory
went back many years, and he even
mentioned ancient dates of his fighting
career, which spanned over ten years.
His modest line, “I was the worst fight-
er in history,” is way out of focus be-
cause his record is a most impressive
one. Joe Sweeney is a man who knows
his way around in life—like he said,
“I'd never have had the opportunity of
meeting the better people in life if it
wasn't for the fight game.’’ Come to
think of it, he looked straight into the
audience.

Staying with the fight game brought
to fore another prominent gentleman,
Mr. George Katz. He’s the manager
of Sonny Liston, the new Heavyweight
Champion. Mr. Katz also manages the
promising Stanley ‘Kitten’ Haywood.
Mr. Katz's views of the fight game were

very interesting, and he spoke loud and
clear of a few shady happenings that
go on behind the backs of John Q.
Public. He’s an outspoken foe of the
dirt that smudges the good name of
boxing. His views on the subject were
evidently shared by the audience, as he
was loudly applauded.

He has the “Champion of the
World” in Charles ‘‘Sonny”’ Liston, and
the future is even brighter for Katz's
“Kitten.”

“Shag’’ Crawford presented the fol-
lowing men with certificates in the
school of umpiring, here at this institu-
tion:

Stanley Grey, Jr. Ronald Crawford
William Archey Frank Armstead
Robert L. Johnson Harry Robinson

The following teams were honored
when presented with trophies for being
the 1962 Champions in their respective
fields:

““Falcons’’—Mexican League Softball
Champs—G.I. Joe, owner;

“Lynx’s’’—-Cuban League Softball
Champs—Dupree, owner;

“Amazons '—EBL Basketball League

Champs—Tampa Reds, owner;

“Wildcats’’—EFL Football League
Champs—Jack Walker and Joe

Chink, owners.

Supt. A.T. Rundle concluded the
night’s program with a closing address
to the inmate audience. Mr. Rundle
praised the honored guests for taking
time out from their own professions to
appear at this banquet to aid the sports
program here by inspiring its progress.
In the eyes of Mr. Rundle, sports is the
greatest medium in the world in which
man. is able to express himself in a com-
petitive field. For in sports, one’s mind
is enhanced to function more greatly
because the mind is being challenged
by a competitor. The truth of the mat-
ter lies within the chemistry of the hu-
man being; it keeps the mind and body
in top physical condition to operate
under the most strenuous circum-
stances. Pointing to the esteemed out-
side sportsmen, Mr. Rundle _ said,
“These men are the prime examples of
greatness in an athlete once he sets
his mind to reach perfection in any
particular endeavor. He also stated
quite clearly that he'll do his utmost
to widen the sports program and see to
it that every opportunity is given to
those who are interested in such a pro-
gram. Wild applause erupted with this
final statement. Thus ended the eve-
ning as the guests filed from the chapel
into the world where many of us are
hoping to follow in the near future.
