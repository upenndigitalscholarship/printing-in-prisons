Friends

by JOHN L. WILLIAMS, Jr.

My classification of a person as being a genuine
friend can be found in the category of one who
knows all about you, and still esteems you in spite
of such knowledge. IF you have such a friend,
then honor, value and protect this friendship with
your life, because it is more than worth it. I be-
lieve the basis of genuine friendship is found in
what I would call generosity. The person who
knows the majority of your faults and yet remains
a true friend, surely overlooks your defects,—which
I consider generosity. Therefore, he is generous to
you, but at the same time he is also humble, because
he realizes that he himself has some defects to be
overlooked by you. A word to the wise is: never
try to conceal your defects from a true friend.
Never boast when you talk to him, because he
knows you well. Letting your friend know that
you realize you do have defects, makes a strong
bond of friendship. But then again, never over-
emphasize your faults to him too much, because it
does become very annoying.

Make Proper Demands

An exceptionally good point that I wish to im-
press upon the mind is that, if you are seeking a true
friend, never demand or expect anything that is
wrong or evil from him. If you ask a person whom
you expect to be your friend to lie for you, commit
an unjust act, or even place his own position in
jeopardy for you, then you are not seeking a true
friend, but only, so to speak, a ‘“‘life saver’’. Ask
nothing of a person that you yourself would not
want him to ask of you, and then you shall find a
great deal to help and sustain you.

Believe it or not, the. world today is full of
people who think and believe that they have a right
to demand, in the name of ‘‘friendship’’, the various
things they want, but which only sully their heart
and mind. The person who places before you the
suggestion that, because he is in trouble, your

friendship for him must be tested by the sacrifice of
your honesty, should be put out of your life at once.
If he is a true friend, he will admire the good in you;
he will not attempt to destroy it.

Equal Partners

Friendship, like marriage, is a partnership of
equals. You cannot expect from a person what you
yourself do not give. I say this from the experience
of a now terminated matrimonial union, as well as
several shipwrecked friendships. More has been lost
than could ever be gained because of not realizing
or caring about this important fact, until it was too
late.

You can lean on your friend with your little
troubles and weaknesses, but never put your heavy
burdens upon his shoulders for him to carry for you.
To lean lightly will make him happy that you came
to him in your troubles, but to lay on him the heavy
burdens that you should carry yourself is to prove
your own selfishness. Your friend has greater
claims on you than has any stranger, so at least be
as much of a gentleman to him... as you would be
to a stranger.

I have found it best not to waste your time
seeking friends, because in seeking, it is usually
extremely difficult to find one. One reason is, be-
cause in wanting one so desperately, and in your
eagerness to find one, there are great possibilities
that you may, so to speak, buy shoddy instead of
good cloth. Take good advice and just wait until
a friend comes into your life, as if unasked, then con-
sider carefully all possibilities before you accept
him fully. Real friendship must grow. Find out
if he is as nearly your equal as may be, but also
try to think of him as being maybe just a little
superior to yourself. Be open and honest with hia
at all times. If he has faults, and who doesn’t,
show them to him by ealling his attention to the
same possible defects in your own: character.
