Special Bulletin

As we went to press, The U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Third District, handed down a precedent
shattering opinion in a case involving criminal in-
sanity. The new decision will probably be called the
Currens Rule after the defendant in the case,Donald
K. Currens. In laying down a rule for future deter-
mination of legal sanity, the court said that a jury
should take into consideration a defendant’s total
personality in deciding whether he should be held
responsible.

The opinion, written by Chief Judge John Biggs,
Jr. held that the M’Naghten Rule was behind the
times and cited ‘‘the advance of medical science”’
as reason for replacing it.

A court spokesman gave an example, ‘‘A man
steals a car, admits that he knew he was doing
wrong, but claims that he heard voices telling him
to steal the car. This delusion, when confirmed by
psychiatric examination would be enough to absolve
him of criminal responsibility.’’

The defendant concerned in the decision, Donald
Currens, stole a car from the city of Manchester,
Ohio, and abandoned the vehicle near the Pitt.,
Pa., Airport. He was convicted in Federal District
court in Pittsburgh of the crime. In appealing the
conviction to the Cireuit Court last fall, Attorney
H. David Rothman attacked the M’Naghten Rule,
under which Currens was found guilty, as ‘‘anti-
quated.’’ His contention was that the Currens Jury
should have applied the Durham Rule.

Judge Phillip Forman joined Judge Biggs in the
majority opinion in the Circuit Court ruling revers-
ing Currens Conviction. Judge William H. Hastie
dissented. Judge Hastie said that he fully pproved
of the new rule, but felt that the M’Naghten Ruie
was adequate in the Curren’s Case.

Judge Biggs, aside from being Chief Judge of the
Court of Appeals, is well known in legal circles for
his modern approach to the problem of determining
mental illness in criminal trials. His book, ‘‘The
Guilty Mind.’’ received the prized Isaac Ray award
and is wildey quoted. In his writings he gives a com-
plete picture of criminal insanity, ranging from
primitive man to our present generation. He estab-
lishes his own position and at the same time docs
not hesitate to give examples of his opponents
views, thereby giving the reader the opportunity
to use his own judgement.

While he only claims a small share in writing the
dissenting opinion in the case of Smith V. Baldi,
(one of the milestones in legal history as regards
criminal insanity) it is apparent that he had given
that opinion much thought in both his book and pre-
paring the Curren’s opinion.

Since we have not had time to accquire a copy of
the Currens Decision, we will print the dissenting
opinion in the Smith Ruling, given in the Third
Circuit Court of Appeals.

A very large part of the confusion which in-
variably results in the trial of the criminal defen-
dant alleged to be insane, lies in the fact that the

realize

law insists that the psychiatrist deal with the mental
states and conditions which do not exist save as
mental conceptions.

In Pennsylvania as in many of the other States
this difficulty arises because of a literal adherence to
the __-_ (M’Naghten Rules) ---_ Mr. Chief Justice
Gibson’s charge in Commonwealth V. Mosler, 4 Pa.
264,was drawn and based on the M’Naghten’s case.
This, we think, must be conceded. The M’Naghten’s
case gave sanctity to the legal theory of‘‘ partial
delusion,’’ this phrase occurring again and again
throughout the opinion. It was employed also as a
fundamental principle by Mr. Chief Justice Gibson
in the Mosler Case. From this hundred-year-old
conception, unchanged by the passage of time, or
the advance of science, grew the ‘‘right and wrong’’
test; i.e., the legal doctrine that the accused may be
found guilty of murder if his state of mind was
such that he could tell the difference between right
and wrong. This doctrine plagues the law of Penn-
sylvania as it does that of most of the other states.
M’Naghten’s Case, like that of Mosler’s Case, as-

sumes the exsistence of a ‘‘____ logic-tight com-
partment in which the delusion holds sway leaving
the balance of the mind intact -___’’, the criminal

retains enough logic in his sanctuary of reason so
that he may inform himself as to what the other
part of his mind, the insane part, has compelled or
permitted his body to do. If the sane portion of the
accused’s mind knows that what the insane part com-
pels or permits the body to do is wrong, the body
must suffer for it by way of electrocution or
hanging obliterating both the good and bad por-
mons) sas) welll as the nesidence of bothe its as) no
answer under the law of Pennsylvania to assert that
the insane part of the mind overcame the sane por-
tion and that therefore the body acted under an
‘irresistible impulse’? to commit the crime because
irresistible impulse is no defense in Pennsylvania.
See Commonwealth V. Schroeder, 1931, 302 Pa. 1,
A. 835. The human mind, however, is an entity. It
cannot be broken into parts, one part sane, the other
part insane. The law, when it requires the psychia-
trist to state whether in his opinion the accused
is capable of knowing right from wrong, compels
the psychiatrist to test guilt or innocence by a
concept which has almost no recognizable reality.
We use the word ‘‘almost’’ advisedly for it is con-
ceivable that the drooling, quaking imbecile has no
quality of mind whatsoever and therefore would
not or could not know the difference between
right and wrong. Such an individual would be un-
likely to commit a crime since the comission of
crime and some activity of mind and body seem in-
seperable.

We can see no reason why the legal test of ir-
responsibility for the commission of a crime should
not be based upon the principle that if the mental
illness of the accused is the proximate or a con-
tributory cause of the crime, then the accused may
not be found guilty of murder, with this finding as
an inevitable corollary would go the commitment
of an accused -_-_ to an appropriate institution.
