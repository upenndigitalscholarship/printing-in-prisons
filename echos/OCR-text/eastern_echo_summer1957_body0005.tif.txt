An editorial

In an AP report picked up by THE EASTON EXPRESS, Arthur T. Prasse,
Commissioner, is reported to have told the legislative committee investigating
the state Pardons Board:

Prisoners ‘‘—have nothing to look forward to but the Pardons Board.
Take away from them the Pardons Board and the Parole Board and you take
away all the hope they have. There could be no program in these institutions.’
He added, ‘‘Our recommendations would be more lenient than the actions of
the Pardons Board.’’

To this editor’s knowledge, this is the first such statement by any top of-
ficial of the Bureau of Correction since its Treatment Program came into being
in 1954. In effect, it could be interpreted to mean, among other things:

(1) that those responsible for the Treatment Program for prisoners re-
cognize it cannot be limited to prisons alone. A treatment philosophy must
reach and permeate members of both Boards. The treatment goal—rehabili-
tation, reorientation, resocialization—must be made the criterion for judging
applications for parole and commutation. Such a criterion to replace any
other which may now be employed, and most especially that aspect which in-
volves a man’s ‘‘popularity rating’’ with his Judge, District Attorney and the
newspapers.

(2) that, barring this coordination between forces keeping the prisoner
and those whose decision and authority it is to release him, prisons, any prison
with any program, the best program ... will continue to fail. |

I do not presume to say that this is what Mr. Prasse meant to imply in his
statement, but it is one interpretation which we of the EASTERN ECHO in-
vite you to consider.

Sincerely yours,
