The vast majority of our youth of today love
their parents. It is this love that helps make a
happy home for both parents and children. The
most substantial proof is the fact that all through
sickness, poverty and all types of troubles, these
complications can be endured just as long as love is
present in the home. However, children do not
always find it easy to be submissive whenever it is
demanded of them to be so. There are times when
they may believe that their parents are unneces-
sarily severe in some of the rules by which they are
to be governed, and in the commands that they are
given.

For instance, there are many parents who
command that their teen-age children must be home
at a certain hour of the night. Not only that, but
many parents disapprove of steady and exclusive
dating .In fact, there are many nights when parents
will not permit them to go out at all, and will de-
mand that their school lessons are to be studied
instead.

Even though these children do love their
parents, they at times believe that this is all too
strict, and probably they would be able to love
their parents even more if they would only allay
their restrictions on them. Teen-agers want to be
without the constant supervision of their parents
because they imagine themselves as being capable
of taking care of themselves and of any complica-
tions with which they may be confronted.

It is most unusual for a teen-ager to form the
opinion that his mother and father are superfluous
and unnecessary, especially when life itself is de-
pendent upon them. Particularly unusual, in view
of the fact that parents continue to be essential
to them until many, many years after birth.

From the very beginning of birth children are
dependent upon their parents. <A new child is the
most helpless of all living creatures. Therefore,
everything must be done for him. The only things
he instinctively knows is how to eat, sleep and let
you know—by crying—when he is hungry or in
pain. Children are dependent upon their parents
for their support, care and needs, until they are old
enough to take care of themselves. Hence, if these
obligations are placed upon their parents, then it is
to be expected that obligations will and should be
placed upon their children.

A mother and father have a perfect right to
command that their son or daughter is to be home
-at a given time when they go out on dates or to a
party. But in the estimation of the son or daughter,
that given time may seem to them too early to have
to return home. But it is their obligation to obey.
Their parents may tell them not to associate with

Teen-Age Obedience

certain other children, or not to read. certain
magazines nor to look at certain programs on tele-
vision. Regardless of how severe or unjust these
orders may seem, obedience and respect must be
given to legitimate parental commands.

Respect to parents means that they are not to
be made fun of. They should not be ealled by
their first name or any other name except the name
that is proper to them as a mother and father. They
must show that respect to their parents at all times,
all through their lives.

Conscientious parents are not at all foolish.

- Quite the contrary. They are responsible for their

children’s welfare and, therefore, have to be some-
what strict. It is their obligation to warn and
prohibit and even make themselves at times a
general nuisance. They are in a much better
position to determine whether or not a certain action
is good or bad, right or wrong. Parents’ minds are
much better developed to make sound judgments
because they have had experiences with the very
same things that some of our youth consider to be
innocent. Parents are only trying to pass on to
their children the lessons learned from some of the
experiences that they themselves were burnt by, so
that they will not be forced to learn the hard way
to their ultimate disadvantage.

The essential fact about obedience for children
will always be, of course, that they do as they are
told. But if this obedience is to benefit the child it
presupposes another very important fact relative
to the parents; namely, that what they tell the child
is in accord with physical, moral and social ac-
ceptance.

When these children grow older, they are going
to meet the requirements of the law. They are
going to have to learn that they must not walk in
the streets but on the sidewalk; that they must not
cross the street against a red light; that they must
not take any of the things in the stores without
paying for them, and so on through the innumerable
must-nots which are essential to a civilized society.

In other words, they have to obey in order to
protect themselves and protect others. If they have
never learned to obey, they are going to have to
learn the hard way—through disobedience and
punishment.

I believe that the simplest and most efficient
way of teaching children to recognize and accept
the laws of society is to instill into their minds the
habit of obedience at home.
