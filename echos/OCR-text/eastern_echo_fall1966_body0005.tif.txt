In 1956, when THE EASTERN
ECHO was conceived—when it was
born—I was here as a member of the
institution staff. During the past ten
years, I have watched it mature with
mixed feelings and some apprehen-
sion. My fears were based upon my
reasoning that the magazine was a
potential tool in the hands of the
criminal; a tool to be used by him
against society after his arrest and
incarceration, such as the jimmy bar,
the shiv and the gun.

Further, it was my feeling that the
ECHO would provide inmates with a
media that could be used primarily
as a gripe sheet in lashing out at the
institution and the correctional sys-
tem which housed him, with un-
justified attacks.

My feelings were based solely upon
my training received in the old days,
before the forming of the Bureau of
Correction; training which was limit-
ed to strict security and custody. The
treatment tools, then, were clubs.
Fortunately, I underwent a period of
transition along with the forming of
the Bureau of Correction by legisla-
tion in 1953 and with the appoint-
ment of Arthur T. Prasse as its
Commissioner.

I was aware at that time, the

Pennsylvania penal system in the
early 1800’s, was the world’s leader

in penology. Obviously, there was a
lagging-behind period; but, under
the progressive leadership of Com-
missioner Prasse, we are again the
leader. :

In looking back over the past ten
years, I can remember pointing with
pride to some of the issues and some
of the articles contained in the
ECHO. There are two in particlar
that come to my attention now, by
way of example. One of the articles
to which I refer was entitled ‘‘Reha-
bilitation via Conservation,’’ author-
ed by Francis Murphy and Johnny
Bowers, both since departed. The
article dealt with the suggestion that
prisoners could be used to restore the
mining areas of Central Pennsylvania
by implementing strip mining pro-
cesses. [I felt the article was very
logically conceived and it still sticks
in my mind, today. The other article
that always impresses me, is INSIDE
INFORMATION. It has always been,
to me, the central part of the maga-
zine—sort of a sub-editorial—which
humorously sums up all the data that
is omitted from the other sections of
the ECHO.

Fall 1966

The Superintendent

I recall particularly one statement
about the roaches...which were
supposed to be getting scarce around
the institution. The author of the
article, at that time, wrote it in
satire. A distinguished penologist
from England was visiting the insti-
tution and was taken by the ability of
the inmate author to poke fun at
himself and his living conditions.

Although I am well aware that we
will not be able to please all peoples
with our administrative policies; nor
will the ECHO be able to please all
peoples with all of their articles and
issues, we feel sure that the progress
which has been made by the various
editors and their staffs—in spite of
having to work at times with various
limited conditions—has certainly dis-
pelled all previous negative thoughts
concerning this particular type of
publication. This fact, alone, is a
recognized hallmark of mature
growth.

It is my feeling that the ECHO,
during the past ten years, has con-
tributed vitally not only to many in-
mates in this and other institutions,

but to outside readers, as well. I now
encourage you to continue your pro-

gram of improving upon present
standards and exhort you to strive
constantly to maintain a very objec-
tive approach to content in all areas
of interest.

To the inmate members of the
various Penal Press publications, and
especially to one of its top leaders,
THE EASTERN ECHO, on the oc-
casion of their Tenth Anniversary, I

wish to extend my sincerest and best
wishes for continued success as you

strive to produce a professional-type
publication and as you endeavor to

make significant contributions to this
important penological media.
