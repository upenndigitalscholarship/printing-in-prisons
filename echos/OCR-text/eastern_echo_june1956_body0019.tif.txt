WHAT IS A CRIMINAL ?

[ee by JOSEPH J CORVL ==
] et’s not rush for our Websters! A simpler and

truer definition would be found if we looked

searchingly within ourselves. It’s there for us
to see if we would be honest with ourselves. By
analyzing ourselves and identifying the timbers that
went into the construction of our monster we will
have isolated the structure of the stigma of
‘Criminal’.

What is a Criminal? Is he a unique secluded
specie? No! He isa part of the human race but a
diseased part. When we are willing to accept this
truism we will have come to grips with our problem.
How many times have we been charged with being
‘tough’, ‘hardened’, when actually the truer descrip-
tion would have been ‘weak’. We are morally weak
for we have not the strength of character to resist
temptation. Temptations are not the sole property
of the criminal. They assail everyone, doctor, law-
yer, beggarman and yes, thief. But, the ones that
fall prey to temptation and have not the moral fibre
to surmount temptation fall into the latter, base
category. If we would only charge ourselves to
fight temptations, use them as building blocks to
strengthen our character, instead of as stumbling
blocks, we will have taken a turn towards relieving
ourselves of our burden.

This author once posed a question to a group of
supposedly ‘honest’ persons who knew of his ecrimin-
al background, and by their answers several of them
branded themselves as harboring criminal instincts.
The question: ‘‘If an opportunity should ever arise
whereby you can steal a large amount of cash with
an extreme minimum of risk would you do so, and if
not, why?” Their replies were unanimously, ‘‘No’’
with such variations as: ‘‘Fear of being caught—”;
“Fear of the resulting incarceration if appre-
hended—’’; ‘‘The disgrace that would reflect on my
family—’’, ete., etc. But the one reply, and the only
one, that identifies a truly honest person came from a
man who replied with humble sincerety, “ Icould
never deliberately cause suffering or hardship to my
fellow man. Money of that kind would never afford
me a moment of peace’’. When this reply registered
on the group they immediately began to qualify their
previous statements. But honesty has no qualifica-
tions. They were caught with their guilt showing
and they knew it. Needless to say, I was persona-
non-grata for the balance of the evening.

However, the above persons are not criminals

for they are able to suppress their tendencies and
to fight temptations whatever their personal reasons.

A criminal is a person who violates the rights of
his fellow man—and himself.

We are all familiar with the various crimes that
men commit upon one another. But, are we aware
of the crimes committed against ourselves? If some
of us are of the attitude ‘to hell’ with the others
then let’s be selfish, if necessary, and put it entirely
upon a first-person singular basis. Are we being
square with ourselves? Have we ever fooled any-
one? Perhaps. But, have we ever fooled our-
selves? I doubt it.

Would you believe it that a criminal does more
harm to himself when he escapes detection? It flat-
ters his ego and urges him on to more daring feats of
crime. The intoxication of his first successful crime
ventures becomes a gnawing hunger which can only
be satisfied by repeated excursions into crime.
Therein a pattern is created. And once a pattern is
established a criminal is almost inextricably bound
to crime. I say almost because many men once
bound by the shackles of their ‘habit’ have, through
determination and a will to lead a normal life, bro-
ken free. It is contrary to man’s better instincts to
live a life despised by his fellow man. I sincerely
believe most of us, at one time or another, have striv-
en to lead the life accepted by society and respected
by our community and family. It just remains for

“us to bend our every effort to the task to gain salva-

tion and freedom.

Personally, I’m ashamed of the name of ‘crimin-
al’, There was a time I carried that nomenclature
about with a completely indifferent attitude. But
now I abhor it and all it’s ugly connotations. I even
dread my release and the subsequent facing of my
children when they will have grown old enough to
become aware of their father’s background. I only
hope that my love for them can overcome their re-
vulsion. Talk of man’s inhumanity to man! The
punishment a criminal inflicts upon himself is more
lasting than any impression his crime may have
had on society.

As for the fallacy of ‘easy money’, let’s face
it! A criminal is the world’s worst paid (shall we
say) craftsman. The same ‘time’ and effort ap-
phed to a legitimate craft would place us in a very
comfortable position. It has probably been of no
particular interest to statisticians to compile figures
comparing the ‘take’ of criminals to the ‘time’
wasted on this effort but we know the scale would
place us well below the average of the lowly
laborer.

So you see fellows, in our position we need not
run to our Websters for the definition. We need
only look into ourselves. What is a criminal?
Yes, I can see it plainly now and it’s neatly summed
up in one word—FOOL.
