Plan For A Penitentiary

“Let a large house, of a construction agreeable to its design
be erected in a remote part of the state. Let the avenue to
this house be rendered difficult and gloomy by mountains or
morasses. Let its doors be of iron; and let the grating occa-
sioned by opening and shutting them, be encreased by an echo
from a neighboring mountain, that shall extend and continue
a sound that shall deeply pierce the soul. Let a guard constant-
ly attend at a gate that shall lead to this place of punishment,
to prevent strangers from entering it. Let all the officers of the
house be strictly forbidden ever to discover any signs of mirth,
or even levity, in the presence of the criminals. To encrease the
horror of this abode of discipline and misery, let it be called by
some name that shall import its design .... The labour
should be so regulated and directed, as to be profitable to the
state. Besides employing criminals in laborious and useful
manufactures they may be compeiled to derive all their subsist-
ence from a farm and a garden, cultivated by their own hands,
adjoining the place of their confinement.”

Dr. Benjamin Rush
