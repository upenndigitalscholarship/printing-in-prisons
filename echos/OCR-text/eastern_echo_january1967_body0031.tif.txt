Color Me Cockroach

by bernard katz

Let me tell you something about cockroaches—
now! The cell I live in has a lot of cockroaches, but
I don’t have any trouble with them, understand, ’m
on the best of terms with them. Tell you how I do
this. Some time ago, I sat down and thought about
the whole matter. I said to myself, “Cockroaches are
human too, just as much as us human beings.” Rea-
son for that is this: I’ve watched them long enough
to realize their sense of discretion, their feelings,
their emotions, their thoughts, see? But you laugh.
You think I’m talking through my hat. You doubt
my word. Wait! Wait!

Now! Time came when I got sick and tired of
finding cockroaches in my things and on my table.
I like cockroaches, but it was too much, you see? I
got a little string—just a little piece of string. Every
time I found a cockroach in my things, I’d give it a
little flip of the string, you see, a little whipping on
the back. Not hard! Not hard! Just-a-little-flick-of
my wrist. Now! The time came when I not only had
them trained so they wouldn’t mess around my
things and such, but they were living in the dust pan
under the table, in peace and plenty, in a real or-
derly fashion, you see. I used to lay down on the
floor and talk to them and watch. Some of them
lived in the pan, some of them were recluses and
went and lived under the sink pipe. Others were
just plain snooty, they had to live in the cracks way
up on the wall. They had all kinds of domestic
troubles, too. Sometimes, a wife would desert her
husband and run off with another character, some-
times two husbands would fight it out; sometimes
one of them would run wild—a bandit, see? And
steal everything in sight, all the bread crumbs and
stuff and carry it off, you see. It was wild, I tell
you, it was wild and weird. Well, here’s what hap-
pened. A time came when the cockroaches from the
next cell began to drift into my place, and naturally,
not being trained, there they were smelling around
on top of my table. I thought I had a revolt on my
hands and wasn’t being firm enough, not realizing
that these were untrained cockroaches causing all
the trouble and I was beating up my own trained

Farce

ones for the sins of others. The way I found out is,
my cockroaches were sulking and resentful, you
understand? When I’d talk to them, they wouldn’t
even look up. I could see their feelings were hurt. I
asked myself, ““What gives here?” Aren’t they hap-
py? Aren’t I treating them right? It dawned on me
about the cockroachs from next door. Well, there I
was, trying to figure out what to do, when my cock-
roaches sort of all got together in the pan and held
a meeting. I could smell trouble was brewing. You
understand? I just sat there, watching. First thing
you know, they all make a beeline (or a cockroach
line) for the hole in the bottom of the wall leading to
the next cell and started fighting the cockroaches
from next door. It was a real knockdown, drag-out
fight like something you’ve never seen—a regular
campaign with flanking attacks and charges and real
erazy generals and everything. It was wild, man it
was wild! Next day the cockroaches from the next
cell stayed where they were put—my own cock-
roaches settled down to a peaceful disciplined life,
and it’s been that way ever since. They keep regular
sentries posted at that hole. Nobody can come in. I
eried for weeks realizing I was punishing my own
cockroaches for the sins of others. I spent days lay-
ing on the floor, trying to explain to them that I
didn’t know, that I couldn’t possibly have known
what was really going on—and they forgave me. As
a reward, I used to blow a little Pall Mall cigarette
smoke toward them, just a little bit at first, to give
them kicks, you understand, and they’d all perk up
at first and lift up their noses and take a real deep
sniff. First thing you know, they were all high on
nicotine. They’re all nicotine heads now. I have to
blow more and more of the stuff all the time to sat-
isfy them. It’s a real kick, you ought to see it. I can
almost see the expression of relief on their faces,
see, because they know they’re really getting the
good weed, not Bull Durham, Target, or any of that
jazz. I was just wondering, do cockroaches ever get
cancer of the lungs like other people do? After all,

they’re human too.
