To the Editor and all the inmates of E.S.P.:

I am leaving this prison to go to Kentucky State
Penitentiary. A big error was found in my case by Mr. ‘‘B’’,
our Warden. According to Pennsylvania Law, Mr. ‘‘B’’ is
now holding me here illegally because my sentence was
supposed to be 2 and one-half to 5 years, not 5 to 20 years.
Mr. ‘‘B’’ found that error. My case is now in the hands
of Judge Waters. A decision will be handed down ‘‘later’’.
Verdict ..... 2

Not many Wardens would let a man know about the
error, or would help you as Mr. ‘‘B’’ has done for me.
Mr. ‘‘B’’ really gets the credit only because he deserves
all the credit he gets. Maybe there are others in the same
fix and it is my hope that he will be able to help them
similarly.

John Carpenter, Jr., B-136
Dear John:

Today, January 14th, 1957, we all learned the verdict
which was handed down in your case. Believe me when I
say that it is the end product in a typical pattern. The
end: your discharge by Order of Court. The pattern: a
studious man who READS, among other things, books of
law. A carefully informed man who conducts his own
research but who listens to all sides, to everybody, to
anybody ... then proceeds to form his own conclusions. A
man of character with strength enough NOT to be a tiger.
Strong enough to believe that right is right regardless of
where the MIGHT just might happen to lie. Such a man
meets such a case as yours—or that of any other nobody
like you. Something HAS to happen. Something good.
Good bless you, John.

Editor
Dear Bob:

.... congratulations on the Winter Issue of HASTERN
ECHO. The cover was beautiful in its simplicity, and the
contents of the publication excellent: promoting the prison-
er in the way he should be promoted by his magazine.

Bob Neese, Editor THE PRESIDIO
Dear Bob:

As I have already written to you, your words ‘‘pro-
moting the prisoner in the way he should be promoted by
his magazine’’ hit us where we most wanted to be known,
understood and respected. As you say further in your letter
to me, PRESIDIO, like the ECHO, speaks FOR the inmate
rather than TO him. But this policy, especially for a
fledgling magazine, can so easily be misconstrued by prison-
ers who are looking for an institutional bulletin. Miscon-
strued as a departure from the purpose of the magazine.
You know, and most prisoners here realize, that ECHO is a
voice OF inmates FOR inmates but slanted so as to include
outside readers in the conversation. And to attract the
interest of outsiders to our way of life, our mutual problems,
and our welfare.

Dear Editor:

Thank you for printing my letter in the Winter issue of
EASTERN ECHO. ... This issue of HCHO was better than
all previous ones. The cover is beautiful, and has the
reverent quality of Christmas. I liked especially John L.
Williams’ article on juvenile delinquency, and your edi-
torial.

Mrs. Dorothy W. Sheer
Dear Mrs. Sheer:
It might interest you to know that John has had ex-

28

cerpts from his articles twice reprinted in PRESIDIO.
(Latest is in the January, 1957, issue.)

Thank you for your valuable public relations contacts,
which we have accordingly followed up. Your continued
interest and help are most welcome.

Editor
Dear Editor:

Mother, Bill and I wish to impose on you to extend
our thanks and sincere appreciation for all the king and
thoughtful gestures made by all the people living in, or
working in or for, the Hastern State Penitentiary. Not
once but many times you came through to help us.

Several weeks before Dad’s death he was given a copy
of the article, ‘‘Farewell Cheif’’ (Winter, 1956). He asked
me to read it to him. Feeling great emotion, I read it to
him, tears streamed down my face. When [I finished, he
said, ‘‘I wasn’t such a bad guy after all, read it again.’’
Mother and I read it to him several times after that; each
time he acquired a great deal of satisfaction and comfort.

Thank you for the last words from the institution. We
were all so happy he could hear them from you, because
you were without a doubt his life.

SOMEWHERE IN ALL HIS WISDOM A LOVING
GOD KNOWS BEST.

Sincerely,
Mrs. Martin, Bill and Margaret
Dear Mrs. Martin, Bill and Margaret:

Though we, as Paul, must say, ‘‘ . how we see
through a glass, darkly’’, yet we join you in your belief
that, despite our ignorance of the workings of His Provi-
dence, we are assured He does know best. Joseph Corvi,
the writer of the article, was deeply touched by your letter
and wishes to express his sincere gratitude for your words.

Dear Editor:

I have been a little tardy in congratulating you and the
administration in the HASTERN ECHO. I have received
all the numbers to date and must say they are excellent.
Especially do I want to congratulate you on the cover of
the last issue. It is beautiful in its simplicity and its sheen.
When I opened the envelope I was immediately struck with
its beauty.

I think it is significant that the administration of
Cherry Hill has permitted, perhaps encouraged, the initiation
of an institution magazine. We have been years behind in
this field. For twenty-five years we have been impressed by
THE ATLANTIAN and for almost that length of time I
have been reading the PRESIDIO from the Iowa prison.
The ‘‘penal press’’ has been the subject of several articles,
both in criminology texts and in the slick-paper magazines.
I consider it one of the best instruments in the resociali-
zation process and in the resolving of that senseless feud
that has too long existed between the inmates and the ad-
ministration. My thesis has long been that, by and large,
prison personnel has been sincerely interested in attempting
to ‘‘reach’’ the inmate—to help him in the tenuous process
in ‘‘going straight’’. I have been a serious critic of im-
prisonment for many years simply because of this feud that
has so long persisted between personnel and prisoner. But
I must frankly state that the staff has attempted to bridge
this gap with more persistance and honesty than have the
prisoners. Administration has been hamstrung with public
apathy and revenge, lack of adequate appropriations, short-
sighted prison labor policies, the frenzy of custody, and other
reactionary attitudes to a degree that prisoners have failed
to separate their good intentions from society’s—perhaps
justifiable—skepticism of the prisoner’s honest determination
to go straight upon release.

Wouldn’t it be an amazing phenomenon if a committee
of Cherry Hill inmates could sit down with some editorial
writers and frankly discuss the crime problem? I believe
much good could come from such a conference. Perhaps
the editors of the EASTERN ECHO could arrange such a
meeting. I am convinced the public could learn a lot about
prisons and prisoners .....

Morrison, we received many compliments. Tasteful and appro-
priate, it was an outstanding contribution to the issue.)
