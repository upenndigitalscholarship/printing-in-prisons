THE CHAMPION VIKINGS!

The Vikings came on strong in the second half
and rolled over all opposition. Their infield was prac-
tically airtight with Bosie Wright at 3rd base proving
to be the anchor man with an exceptional glove.
McSwain at short, Cantoral at 2nd, and Smith at
first provided Eddie Brewer with considerable sup-
port. Brewer who was a real work horse on the mound
pitched every game. While many expected him to wilt
from the amount of pitching he did, he simply went
on winning and became the league’s only thirty game
winner. It will be diffueclt for anyone else to compete
with him when it is time to vote for the most valuable
player. Goody encountered many problems putting
this team together and credit should be given for
his fine job of building a championship club. Credit
due also to Robert ‘‘Pinkie’’ Pincavitch who joined
the team late in the season and caught many impor-
tant games for them.

METS

The merger of the two leagues proved to be a dis-
aster for the Mets. The first half was all Mets who ran
away from the rest of the league and finished the
half with a six game lead. When the Mets became
affihated with the Braves of the Cuban league it
provided that they send their better players to the
parent Braves. As a result the Mets lost their entire
infield, two thirds of their outfield, and their number
one pitcher, Walkie Talkie. Walkie posted an impres-
Sive 7-2 record with a number of saves to his credit
before moving on to the Braves team. The Mets were
able to play respectable ball through most of the sec-

34

ond half before slumping badly towards the end of
the season and into the playoffs. The one bright spot
in the overall season was Winnie in left field who
paced the attack at an incredible clip to finish the
Season with a gaudy .586 batting average to lead the
league in that department.

PHILLIES

The Phillies after a pathetic first half were able
to field a very respectable club in the second half.
Willie Billingsley, the owner, never stopped trying

‘to make his club a contender. His biggest steal was

in obtaining ‘‘No No’’ Smith to handle the pitching
chores. As we all know, ‘‘No No’’ has probably won
more games here than any other pitcher, career wise.
His pitching as expected strengthened the club con-
siderably,- however he joined the team so late that
the team effort to overhaul the front running Vikings
was in vain. John Hughes at shortstop covered a lot
of territory and took many potential hits away from
the enemy.

LYNX

The question of what happened to the Lynx has
stumped all of the players and fans alike. As a first
half team they held their own with any other club in
the league. The second half was an entirely different
storv, however. Owner ‘‘Chico’’ Morales had trouble
at times even fielding a team. The turnover of per-
sonnel was so great that often it could not be deter-
mined exactly who were members of the team. ‘‘ Hill-
billy’’ pitched many fine games only to see his efforts
squandered by costly errors and futile base running.
He deserved a better fate.
