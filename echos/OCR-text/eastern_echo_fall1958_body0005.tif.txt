Our newspapers continue to snipe and yell at our commutation and parole boards. They ride the
Administration every chance they get.

Constant harping and sniping at the purported shortcomings of any parole or commutation system
furnishes an abundance of ‘’griping’” material to while away the endless hours for those who care to
indulge. It is significant that it furnishes little else and it is unfortunate that nothing of a constructive
nature results from these oral marathons.

The determinations on which individual paroles or commutations are granted are possibly as varied
and as mutiple as the cases that come up for consideration. In any event it is not the purpose here to

However, if we can assume that the public has a stake in the matter of parole or commutation—
and a considerable portion of penal journalism tends to that impression—it would follow that favorable
relations would be the aim of every man in prison and, more importantly, of every man on parole.

We know that there are groups in society that, for diverse reasons, would stifle any parole or
commutation program by whatever means at hand.

A recent example of one technique is fresh in mind. One of our local dailies, in treating a local
crime, began its story thusly:

“Parolee arrested in crime wave. Sentence recently commuted by—”

There is no way of gauging the antagonisms generated by this type of news handling. There is no

that there is no parole like a successful parole. No one is so simple as to suggest that public opinion is
of no importance.

Therefore, it can be said that a man on parole can be of inestimable influence to the future chances
of prisoners everywhere in the proper conduct of his parole. On the other hand, having failed it, he
has done a definite disservice to the men he left behind by furnishing further ammunition to the
