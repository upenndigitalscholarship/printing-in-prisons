BIG BEAT IN E.S.P.

Or

Sounds of the Big Beat resounded throughout
the institution on the evening of July 21, as the
FURNESS BROTHERS, one of America’s top re-
cording and night club instrumental groups, freely
donated their many talents in providing an evening
of entertainment for the Inmates of ESP. Mr.
Jimmy Shorter, President of the Musicians Union
Local of Philadelphia and Institutional Personnel are
to be congratulated in securing the talents of so fine

a group.

The aggregation consisted of Bill Furness at
piano, Al Berry on saxophone, Art Lone on guitar,
Junior Furness on bass and Joe Furness at the
drums. This was indeed enough to sway the inmate
audience into a frenzy of excitement with the rock
and roll beat so popular today. This reporter and
all concerned were particularly thrilled by the per-
formance of this dynamic combo. They offered a
repertoire of the popular swing numbers, embel-
lished with the smooth singing style of young Al
iB eriaye

The perennial favorite of the night was the
artistic bass playing of Junior Furness who dropped
to a crouching stance and drew thunderous ap-
plause with his stylish playing. The Furness Bro-
thers warmed up to their audience with such soft
numbers as, Witcheraft, To Be Loved, and then in a
great crescendo of sound, went into full swing with
the blues beat of Night Train, Honky Tonk and
many more. A great admiration was felt, for their
ability to play requests on moments notice. This
truly indicated the professionalism, and versatility

of this combo.

One of the amusing and pleasurable incidents,
was little Hercules Butler, getting into the act and
stopping the show with his unique style of dancing.
This former pro-stepper who daneed under the
name of Chico La-Tee, was rewarded amply by the
joyous shouts of his fellow inmates.

The Furness Brothers bowed out with their own
composition of “Junior’s Blues” dedicated to their
bass player, Junior Furness. They expanded their
already fine reputation by swinging morally as well
as musically into the hearts of all the men.

It is fitting that I add a personal injective here.
The summer months have been welcomed joyously
by the inmate population, due largely to the ex-
pansion of the entertainment facilities. These
shows have not only been a souree of pleasure, but a
mental awakening to a brighter future within the
confines of the institution. It is with great anti-
cipation that we look forward to the coming spring,
and more wonderful entertainment. In departing,
I leave you this thought, “Many times in life we
must embrace the immediate and actual things as
well as the distant and perfect hope.”

A bird’s-eye view of the occasion.
