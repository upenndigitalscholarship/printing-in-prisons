COME HOME, ANGEL!

by JOSEPH ROSSELLI

Over these prison walls flew a slender, disheveled
pigeon, skittering to a muddy one-point landing in
the small exercise yard adjoining Hobby Alley.

Her landing gear plainly damaged in the early
morning’s lashing rainstorm, she now huddled for-
lornly against the iron-grille gate like a soul with-
out a friend.

Not quite. ‘‘Get Russ!’’ shouted a member of
the clean-up crew towards the narrow Alley.
‘“There’s another one-legged Sally out here.’’

In a moment, the stout, ancient door of the end

shop creaked open. Hobby Alley’s tall, genial-.

smiling Bill Russell waded across ankle-deep mud
of the yard. With grimy, scarred hands, he gently
gathered up the trembling pigeon.

Back in the Alley Shop with Sally braced in the
warmest corner of Russ’s oblong bench, he swiftly
began trimming wood for splints. Others in the
shop, ‘‘Long-Time’’ Dave Aikens and Billy Wright
had.already started procuring tin tops full of fresh
water along with Weight-Lifting Champ William
Bakey breaking salted peanuts into small bits, a
discovered quick energy restorer.

By the time Sally had stopped shaking like a
leaf and sampled a few beakfuls of food, Russ was
ready to set the broken limb. So expertly moved
his fingers, as Big Bakey held the squirming Sally
firmly, that by the time the noon whistle exhausted
its ear-deafening shriek, Operation Leg Repair
stood completed. Uttering not so much as an ap-
preciative ‘‘coo,’’ Sally greedily resumed feasting on
the remainder of Big Bakey’s delicacies.

Before the hot sun traversed the century-and-a-
quarter old cell-block roofs many more mornings,
Sally would be up and off, flying over the high wall.
Sleek and sassy, she would be remembered as an-
other brief interlude sandwiched between prison
tasks, brightening the grey sickness of bleak
monotony.

Only several months earlier there had been the
Spring visit from Wrong Way Corrigan, the Parra-
keet. Undoubtedly he believed he was flying home-
ward from a neighborly visit in South Philadelphia.
Instead, he landed due West of the Delaware River,
in the Big House.

Besides that, a cool, brown sparrow recuperat-
ing from an injuried shoulder, learned to ‘‘enun-
ciate’? Wrong Way’s spicy phrases. Becoming

close buddies, they shared food together and
followed each other around the Shop. All through
days of convalescence the sharp sparrow mimicked
the Parrakeet’s lingo, causing bellows of laughter
from his benefactors.

Wrong Way proved one of the happiest birds
to be set. on the right way home, and was still an-
other pleasant memory these little feathered am-
bassadors had added to Russ, Billy, Dave and
Bakey’s shopful of rich memories acquired during
their combined total of some eighty-eight years in
durance vile.

Starved pigeons and half-blind robins, ailing
songbirds and fallen sparrows—some with crushed
wings, others with broken legs and still others
given up for dead. Yet, with simple aids of sun-
baths, eye washes, wood splints, reclaimed feathers
and doses of codliver oil administered with justice
and tempered with kindness, each was given a new
lease on life. A new contract to fly the width and
breadth of spacious azure blue skies again. This
by four men, three for whom Lady Luck throughout
the reign of half a dozen Governors and Pardon
Boards, continued to roll ace-deuce.

One strange and almost unbelievable opera-
tion performed involved Pigeon MacGregor’s still
talked about pair of wings. MacGregor’s sad
plhght had its discovery on the day marked for
Sally’s bon voyage.

Smoothing Sally’s dark velvety head in parting
farewell, Russ squeezed Sally between the iron
grille separating the Alley from the exercise yard.
He tossed her towards the high noon sun. As she
gained altitude a commotion arose at the lower end
of the north cellblock. Several fellow-prisoners
stood helplessly watching efforts of another pigeon
furiously flapping its wings in a valiant attempt to
fly.

In every community, whether hemmed in by
stalwart city blocks or closeted by stout, iron cages,
there flourishes good and bad seed. There are
thoughtless as well as thoughtful human beings;
and one, whose conduct-rating on a scentometer
would explode its mercury, had maliciously snipped
the pigeon’s wing feathers—every last one.

Hach succeeding effort the gallant pigeon made
to fly ended with a crunching crash against the
ancient stones of the gaunt cell block. Up the
