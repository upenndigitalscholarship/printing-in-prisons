‘ HENRY MYERS

Aside from circulation’s rise and fall, nothing
so accurately conveys to a newspaper publisher the
opinions of those people who digest the paper’s
policy, news and views as that column appearing on
the editorial page and entitled “Letters to the Edi-
WO

Into this column every man can take his jour-
nalistic plunge while contradicting the king-makers,
spouting indignantly about the price of rice in China,
or basing a prediction of disaster upon a sudden
fluctuation on the stock exchange. Right or wrong,
this column gives John Doe the opportunity to ex-
press his beef.

Although he may not be able to construct in
his mind the magnitude of billions, he can, while he
rides home from his sixty-buck-a-week-job, snap his
nickel paper together and begin planning a letter of
ire at his country’s over-generosity.

Young Joe Doakes, filled with the holy zeal of
his first practical physics course, gasps in astonish-
ment at the theorisms of a Von Braun or a Willie
Lay, adhering to the straight letter of the law in
space matter, time and mankind. And his fingers
just burn with the urge to relate his discovery of an
error (to him, oh so obvious) in some basic law.

Because we live in a democracy, even the low-
lest citizen has the right to agree or disagree with
the dictates of his lawmakers. Here, even the out-
east can, with dignity, voice his views, crying out
against various injustices which show their evil
heads from time to time.

In “Letters to the Editor” the outraged Mother
shakes a verbal finger at the four-wheeled threats to
her brood.

The little, lady bird-lover appeals to others
gentle of heart.

The old-timer drops a line defending the Phillies
and/or: Mayo Smith.

The veteran corrects a geographical misquote
relative to some pain-remembered strip of beach.

The politician spouts off under the guise of the
pureness of his party.

Again and again, your voice is given its day.
Your claims, observations, threats and witticisms
are read and digested by readers throughout this
land of ours, wherein the fourth estate knows no
bounds.

Perhaps your words will have some effect, cre-
ating a movement to bring change to some benign
blot on our system’s character; a blot that your voice
brought to hght. Then again, your letter may arouse
no more interest other than the fact it was printed,
it being one among many as a grain of sand upon a
beach. Still, the important fact is that what YOU
had to say made its way into all places where man
retreats to study how the world around him reacted
to another day’s events.

The following “Letter to the Editor” merits re-
print. It demands reprint if for no other reason than
its being a fitting rebuttal to the mud-slingers who
make a living by taking pop-shots at today’s teen-
agers. An intelligent teenager’s view; it is one of
truth, a dispeller of fabrication. It is many things,
but above all, it is a promise. A promise for tomor-
row which leads us to believe that, regardless of the
sordid picture sensationalistie headlines has painted,
the future will be in pretty capable hands.

The following is a teenage girl’s reply to a citi-
zen, a not too christian citizen who suggested this
bouquet of wisdom, “LOCK THEM UP AND EXE-
CUTE THEM!”

From the PHILADELPHIA DAILY NEWS

32

A recent letter stated that all convicts should be executed. I very strongly
disagree with the writer. Although I am only an average teen-ager, I believe
that every person deserves a second chance.

The person who wrote that letter must think he has never done anything
wrong during his entire life. Can this person look back on his life and say that
he has never cheated in a test, stolen a piece of candy, or told a lie? If so, he
should be up on a throne for all the world to look up to as diffenent, but at the
same time to look down on as the one person who is too good for the common
man to associate with.

Perhaps if this person would spend more of his time helping someone, who
has made one mistake and paid his debt to society, get back on his feet instead
of condemning them, he would be a far better person. —SUSAN SMITH
