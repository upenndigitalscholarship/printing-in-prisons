DO!

NONORED

A friend to those in
need of friendship

Twenty-thousand prison inmates paid honor by
proxy to a Philadelphia woman in the auditorium at
Eastern State Penitentiary when ECHO proclaimed
Dot Scheer Mrs. Public Relations of the Penal Press.

ECHO was joined by some 30 other penal press
publications—representing prisoners from this coun-

try, Canada and Latin America—in paying tribute
to Dot Scheer, a woman who works tirelessly in be-
half of prison inmates everywhere.

A persistent letter writer, an unflagging contacter
of people, Dot works away at her self-appointed task
of winning friends for prisoners, now in touch with a
broadcaster, now an editor, or perhaps even an offh-
cial of the United Nations; so impressing them with
her sincerity and deep faith in the goodness of men
everywhere that she is constantly widening and
lengthening an avenue of understanding between
prison inmates and the general public.

A very warm and human person, filled to the brim
with love and compassion forall peoples, Dot's life
could well be a lodestar for others to follow. Her
cheery outlook on life with all its complexities, her
deep and abiding faith that there is good in all men
if one only seek it out, her ever-poised typewriter
ready at a moments notice to take up our cause, all
these testify to the rightness of ECHO’s presentation
to her of the scroll proclaiming her Mrs. Public Rela-
tions of the Penal Press.

We don’t know Dot’s religion—she may be
Catholic, Hindu or other—but we do know that the
life she lives is the life all good people should be
proud to live: a life of service to others, which, as
Dot herself would admit, is constantly enriched be-
cause she is repaid manyfold in satisfaction for what
she does for others.

A heart big enough to embrace all humanity,
single-spaced letters full of ideas and hints about a
wide range of subjects, a cheery, openhanded smile
which says “I’m your friend:’’ these are some of the
images which come to mind when we think of Dot

Scheer.

She is more than these, though, as a mother is
more than the dictionary definition, “‘a female par-

ent.
She is acceptance when there is none.
She is understanding where it is lacking.
She is a friend, with all that this word implies.

Who is there who has not, more than ever before,
welcomed a sunsplashed morning when the night

-was long and dark and cold?

What friendless prisoner, bound within the shell of
distrust and misunderstanding and fear, what pris-
oner does not doubly welcome an open hand and a
cheery smile when it is proffered to him, freely?

We are happy that the ECHO played a part in
giving at least a small measure of recognition to a
woman who so richly deserves it.
