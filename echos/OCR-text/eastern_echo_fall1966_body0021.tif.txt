Twenty times winner of the annual National Qual-
ity Award, presented to insurance underwriters for
excellence, Mr. Colborn is also a member of the Penn
Athletie Club.

Colborn enjoys visiting and corresponding with
his many friends residing behind these gray and
brown stone walls; “stone cottage,” as he used to tell
one of his friends who served time here (Colborn
used to refer to him as “the banker”), for whom he
has since been successful in securing a commutation.

We asked Mr. Colborn of his primary avocations.
He replied: “Only my work in lending a helping
hand to deserving inmates of the various Pennsyl-
vania correctional institutions.”

He said that his objectives were helping men who
made a tragic mistake, to start a new life. “I must,
however, be very discriminating due to some bitter
disappointments,” he said.

As far back as he ean recall, he has had compas-
sion and commiseration for human beings who have
been inearcerated for long periods of time. He said
that a great many of these men deserved being given
long terms of imprisonment; but, he believes that
others, due to the infuriated indignation of the sen-
tencing judge, have received sentences far and be-
yond the period justified for the crime or crimes for
which they may have been found guilty.

Mr. Colborn became actively interested in lending
a helping hand to prisoners as the result of an of-
fense committed by the son of a very good friend.
“This man was never too stable,” Mr. Colborn said.
“When he was a young man he belonged to the vol-
untary fire department in my community, and was
always thrilled when a fire took place. Apparently
... there were not enough fires occurring, so he, to-
gether with two of his cronies, were later found
guilty of arson. He was given a frightfully long sen-
tence.” But, Mr. Colborn explained that although
he was deserving of paying a stiff price to society
for the kind of criminal behavior he exhibited, the
long sentence was a classic example of virtually un-
controlled anger on the part of the judge, who meted

out an unreasonably long sentence of thirty to sixty .

years in prison.

He continued, “Had he served out the entire sen-
tence, he would have been an elderly man when re-
leased. I felt sorry for him after he had served a
number of years and decided to pay him a visit in
prison. All of his so-called friends had long since
lost interest in him. The only ones, other than I, who
ever visited him, were his relatives. One day I asked
the young man if there were men at his place of con-
finement whom he knew never received a letter from
anyone— and who never received any visitors even
at Christmas time. He assured me there were many
in that category.” This recalled to my mind the
time when I was in the Army, during World War I,
when I would eagerly await mail call in the hopes of
hearing from my loved ones, or anyone. When two
or three days would elapse without any word from
home, I was a bit despondent.”

Mr. Colborn continued. “These thoughts prompted
me to call the warden of the Eastern State Correec-
tional Institution to volunteer corresponding with

Fall 1966

those whom he knew were completely friendless;
that is, men who never received any kind of mail and
who never received visitors. It was my original in-
tention to correspond with these men to make them
feel that there was at least one person who was in-
terested in their welfare. I was furnished with ten
names. To each one I wrote the same letter volun-
teering to correspond with him—and I stated that
there were others in the institution who were receiv-
ing the self-same letter. I thought perhaps two or
possibly three would acknowledge and welcome my
friendship. I assumed that the others would think
it was some kind of a trick; but to my surprise,
eight of these men replied with heart-felt expressions
of gratefulness. I had thought of only corresponding
with these men. But, like “Little Topsy” it grew.
Each one implored me to visit with him. Each one
told me his tale of woe.”

Following this start, Mr. Colborn began an active
interest in assisting prisoners to secure parole plans
—home, job and sponsor—required by the Board of
Parole prior to an inmate’s conditional release from
prison. He has offered help to all kinds of offenders:
murderers, burglars, and robbers; however, he
chooses carefully any narcotics offenders, sex offend-
ers, or forgers, because of the psychological dynam-
ies involved in their committing such offenses.

Mr. Colborn has frequently appeared personally,
in behalf of inmates before the Pennsylvania Board
of Pardons, seeking clemency for his friends in
prison. He has, more than onee, taken time out from
vacation breaks at the seashore to return to Penn-
sylvania when the Pardon Board is to consider one
of “his cases,” to enter a strong plea. As the result
of his deeds he has come to know each member of
the Board quite well. The Board knows he does not
earn any money from his representation of inmates;
in fact, he frequently loans or gives funds to men to
help them get re-started in society. His trips to
various parts of the state, on behalf of inmates, are
personally financed.

Over the years, he has been disappointed by a few
of his “prison friends.” But the large majority have
continued to maintain law-abiding conduct and
records as members of free society.

He visits the institution regularly—mostly on
holidays and weekends during his otherwise free
time—to counsel his friends. But, mostly, he wants
to be their real friends; to instill confidence; to offer
hope and to manifest a genuine example of human
concern and human love for fellow men less fortu-
nate than himself.

Currently, Mr. Colborn is acting as parole advisor
(sponsor) for eighteen parolees. He has sponsored
many times that number. In addition, he is presently
visiting and corresponding with approximately 20
inmates at this institution, and quite a number con-
fined in other state correctional institutions.

Truly, it ean be said this man is performing a vital
human service not only to convicts and former con-
victs, but to society in general. How ean his service
really be adequately measured?

We have here, in William T. Colborn, a friend in
deed when a friend is needed!
