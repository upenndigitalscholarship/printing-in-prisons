changed. The essence of life is change, and we can
hope that change means growth. All nature changes
from minute to minute, from day to day, and change
likewise comes to the eternal mystery that is man’s
personality.

The lawbreaker, like any other individual with
the ability to read, is well aware that parking tickets
and felony indictments often end up in the same
wastebasket. And although he may contribute to it,
the lawbreaker does not create this condition.

Of what avail therefore, would it be to attempt
to curb the errant ways of the lawbreaker if these
age-old customs remain uncurbed? These deeply im-
bedded customs lend encouragement to lawbreakers
in all walks of life; to the affluent as well as the less
fortunate.

Our economic system demands price supports for
basic commodities such as peanuts. Our greatest
basic commodity is human endeavor — a priceless
intangible without uniform support.

Those gainfully employed, in addition to paying
taxes, fulfill the needs and services of this nation.
They are the core of our economie system. One con-
fined in a penal institution obviously does not con-
tribute in any manner to the general welfare.

It would indeed be a strange paradox 1f labor at-

providing financial security for its members, lured
potential lawbreakers into its ranks. It may well
be that in attaining this goal, labor may, in years to
come, lower prison populations to an appreciable ex-
tent. If a guaranteed annual wage spells security
for labor, and this likewise is the goal of the law-
breaker where material values are at stake, here then
is an area worthy of study.

When this form of security is made available to
the lawbreaker as an alternative to the risks and con-
sequences entailed in all crime, the answer as to the
course reason will take is obvious.

Everything known to man in the field of punish-
ment as a penalty for lawbreaking has now been
tried for centuries past, and the end product has been
a tragic spectacle and an indictment of civilization.

Is it not now time for the learned men and
women of this nation to take heed and consider the
ill-conceived methods of handling crime and punish-
ment problems of the past with a view towards initi-
ating intelligent measures? This rather than permit
the blind to lead the blind at the expense of future
oenerations.

As we commenced with an ancient adage, it is
fitting we close with another: “One half of the world
does not know how the other half lives.” We wonder
if this is not due, in no small part, to both fractions
being too complacent?

A Dinner For le

A banquet was held here at Eastern on Tuesday,
Oct. 13, 1959. Being present, seated at the press
table as an observer, has been for me the finest ex-
perience of nigh on to two decades of imprisonment.

Twelve men were being honored. They were
seated at the flower-banked center table, which
formed the leg of the T wherein the Toastmaster and
guests sat.

Rev. Father John J. McHugh, Catholic Chaplain,
gave the invocation.

The dinner began with shrimp cocktail followed
by tenderloin steak, french fried potatoes, peas, fried
onions, tossed salad, celery hearts, olives, pickles,
rolls, butter, ice cream with fruit, and coffee.

The inmate cooks and custodial stewards are to
be congratulated. The dinner was dispatched with
gusto by all in attendance, giving proof of the gour-
met’s touch. The service of the waiters, all inmates,
also should be extolled, — it was exemplary.

As toastmaster, Dr. Michael Morello, Director
of Treatment here at H. S. P., introduced the guest
speakers.

In his address, Arthur T. Prasse, Commissioner
of Correction, let us in on a small secret, as to who
footed the bill for the affair. He stated that the ex-
pense could possibly have been drawn from the
state’s budget, but such was not the case. The mem-

EASTERN ECHO

bers of the staff here at Eastern, without any fanfare,
dug into their own pockets, each contributing a share
towards the cost incurred. I know of no other inci-
dent in the past that demonstrated better inmate-
personnel relations, thus ridiculing the old bug-a-boo
that a wall of restraint must be maintained at all
times between inmates and custodians. The sincerity
of their gesture became more evident because of its
utter lack of publicity.

Space does not permit Mr. Prasse’s entire ad-
dress, or the fine talks given by Harry A. Snyder,
Ph. D., Educational specialist, and Robert H. Coates,
Director of School Extension, Phila. School System,
guest speakers.

In his off-the-cuff manner, Commissioner Prasse
extoled the manifold virtues of an education. He
lent emphasis to the values it can accrue, and the
limitlessness of the dividends it can pay. He related
the histories of several men who, after obtaining
a High School Diploma, went on to successful en-
deavors, one of them even becoming a teacher, and
later — a school principal.

The outside press was represented by Mr. James
McGee, reporter, and Jack Finney, photographer,
both of the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin.

Superintendent William J. Banmiller presented
the diplomas to the graduating class. Those gradu-
ating were: Joseph John Corvi, Robert Francis
Cullen, James Daunt, Paul Delehanty, Charles Don-
nelly (paroled), Barrett Duke (transferred),
Howard Harrison, Benjamin Jacobson (paroled),
Norman Pearson, Henry Saby (transferred), Louis
Raymond Straccioni, and Wiliam James Wright.

The benediction by Rev. McHugh brought the
evening’s festivities to a close.
