A sad commentary on the crude practices of
modern Burglary was exhibited here last April.
At that time two of our staff psychologists were
interviewing a guard applicant within the confines
of Mr. Morello’s Office. Upon completion of the
interview they tried to leave the office—and tried—
and tried. The trying finally reached proportions
of magnitude including the entire maintenance de-
partment equipped with enough tools to raze the
building.

It all started with a jammed knob on the office
door. Amid casual bits of advice from certain
burglars as to how to open the door, Lt. Roach
worked frenziedly, vowing to have them out in
“Just a minute,’’ which an hour later stretched into
‘‘another 15 minutes’ and finally settled on a vague
promise of ‘‘thirty days’’.

Reinforcements arrived in a continuing stream
as one emergency alarm followed hard on the heels
of another. A communications system was estab-
lished with the trapped men inside, whose only
request was ‘‘Don’t forget the door is actually un-
locked!’’ Which for some strange reason made the
Lieutenant’s eyeballs roll around.

Steadily he advanced through all the primary
drills in the Burglar’s Manual: (1) battering the
knob and lock assembly with a maul, hoping to
shock it into working order or completely break
up the whole system, with the only result being
that the maul broke; (2) removing the knob and
lock mechanism only to find that with 2 big holes
in the steel door the important parts of the assembly
were still intact and completely inaccessible; (3)
trying to remove the hinges, which could not be
found; (4) using jimmies in a vain attempt to warp
the door, ete. ete.

At this point Sgt. Cunningham, who had ar-
rived on the scene with Task Force 58, stepped
forward. At his suggestion, heavy tools were passed
through the outside windows to the trapped men

who were directed to remove the pins which were
observed to be on the inner side of the door. Pins
still refused to budge either up or down after a
steady, combined and varied assault. Lt. Roach is
alleged to have commented wryly, ‘‘ That little howl-
er ate up another half hour. You got any more
brilliant ideas?”’

A helpful ex-burglar now pointed out that the
steel window sash in the door had been secured with
12 screws at the time of installation. With a sigh
of relief, Lt. Roach fell upon the door, scraping
and banging until half the paint was removed with-
out uncovering screw one. Operations were then
shifted back inside where 12 large screws were un-
covered and laboriously removed. Jimmies applied
from both sides revealed only that the sash was
welded solid to begin with.

A general assualt was ordered during which
every burglar in the maintenance department had a
erack at the door. When the havoe and confusion
at last subsided it was found that the wall on the
south side of the door had cracked open, which led to
the bitter suggestion ‘‘Dam the door! Let’s take the
wall down around it.’’

At which point Warden Martin wisely inter-
vened, ‘‘Hold it, Clyde! There will be no walls de-
molished here. Time was, this place was crawling
with burglars and safe-crackers. Now, I can’t get
an unlocked door opened. Burn the frame out!’’

As simple as that, the torches were applied, the
trapped men freed. Viewing the debacle, Warden
Martin commented, ‘‘In the old days, one good burg-
lar with a small lock pick could have opened that
door if I had ever given him a 10 second start.’’
