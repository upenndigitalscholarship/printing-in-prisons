Let poets piece prismatic words—

Bird Cantos

What ecstasy moves you to sing
such lovely arias to Spring?
Is it the scent of the newborn rose
that inspires your arpegioes?
Is it the warmth of a bright, Spring day
that makes your music light and gay?

Is it the loving mood in you
that makes each little note so true, _
and makes me smile when | am blue?

Op ci Goa Sainspiiine: Touch
O'nightingale, O'little thrush,
that makes me like you oh so much?

With every little note you sing,
it makes me wish that | were Spring;
So you could sing to me all day,
You'd make skies blue from those of gray.

But even now a mortal |,
I’m so glad to hear your cry;
Would that some poet write fit words
to fit the lustrous sound of birds.

Give me the happy sound of birds.
