Penal Exchange Notes

The Echo Staff wishes to thank all the Institutions
for sending us their Penal Magazines. In the future
we hope to. satisfy them the way they have satisfied
us. With this edition we have made space, so that we
may show our thanks to the fine writers of the penal
press. Due to shortage in space, we may only be al-
lowed to thank so many in every edition. Keep up
the good work fellows.

THE NEWSY NEWS, ROCKWELL CITY, IOWA

The Staff of the Newsy News is having trouble
finding a new name for their magazine, well if you
ask me I think the name fits because women are
always looking for news to gossip about. But all kid-
ding aside girls, the Echo Staff thinks that you have
a fine magazine and a good name, and you are doing
a very good job on the magazine, we look forward to
your poems.
