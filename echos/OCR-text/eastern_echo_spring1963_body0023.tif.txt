The ESP Chess Club has closed the
curtain on the most disasterous season
in its history. In early 1962, the Cham-
pionship Team twice had the oppor-
tunity to clinch the City Champion-
ship, but in both of these crucial match-
es, had blundered away the title.

To better illustrate the disaster of
1962, we give the following statistics
of play against outside competition,
both league and social matches, since
the inauguration of the club in 1957.

Practically a new Championship
Team was fielded for the 1962-63 City
Championship with Leonard Massey,
Alfred Hewitt, and Joseph Antonie-
wicz replacing former players. Thomas
Williams and Martin Pearson are hold-
overs from previous years.

The team immediately proceeded to
follow the pattern set earlier in the
year, losing to Germantown “Y’’ (3-2)
(4-1),
mainly due to a lack of confidence in
their ability. On the whole, their play
has indicated they will do better in
1963.

and tto’ Franklin-Mercantile

In the Germantown match Pearson
and Massey lost to Kalenian and Domo-
byl. Hewitt won from Segal. Williams
and Antoniewicz drew with Kelly and
Selensky. In the Franklin match Good-
fellow (substituting for Williams), Mas-
sey and Antoniewicz lost to Zelitch,
Goregliad and Agre. Pearson and
Hewitt drew with Chertkof and Father
Williams.

The Reserve Team has not started
their league play, but will have a full
schedule after the holidays. Floyd
Jackson, Harry Farrell, Nathaniel Spen-
cer, John Grandy, and William Holley

are members of this team.

The Industrial Team has played two
matches, losing to Phila. Electric and
drawing with Chester Pike. The mem-
bers of the team are new to tournament

play and, as a result, had suffered a
severe case of “butterflies.” They will
eventually overcome.this and make bet-
ter showings in their remaining
matches. ~

The team consists of Karl Thornton,
John Orsino, John O’Shaughnessy, Wil-
liam Hamlet, and Nathaniel Easley.

In the Phila. Electric match Orsino
won from Daley. O’Shaughnessy drew
with Milone. Thornton, Hamlet and
Easley lost to Kelly, Gross and Moses.
In the Chester Pike match Thornton
and Easley won from Braumbaugh and
Finn. O'Shaughnessy drew with Mitc-
hell. Hamlet and Orsino lost to Mc-
Kennzie and Ritter.

The fifth annual club championship
tournament has reached the halfway
mark with the final winner still in
doubt. Upsets have been routine in
this tournament, for players in the low-
er class are taking full advantage of
the opportunity to make big strides
on the rating list by meeting with the
top players.

The biggest upset of all has been
William Holley’s upset of Club Cham-
pion Martin Pearson. Holley’s play
should be an inspiration to other mem-
bers of the club, for he has demonstra-
ted that continual study, perseverence

and confidence pay off.

Other noteworthy upsets are:
Charles Vanderhost over Joseph An-
toniewicz, John Grandy, and Nathaniel
Easley; Harry Farrell over Alfred Hew-
itt, Leonard Massey, and Joseph An-
toniewicz; John Boling over Nathaniel
Spencer and John Grandy; William
Hamlet’s losses to Robert Kuchs and
Bernard Harris; Edward Uzdeinski over
John O’Shaughnessy; Bernard Harris
over Nathaniel Easley; Anthony Ro-
mano drawing with Frank Bordner;
Matthew Smith drawing with Nathaniel
Spencer.

A complete run-down on all league
matches and the final standings in the
Club Championship Tournament will
be given in the next issue.
