THE EASTERN ECHO is printed by and for the inmates of the Eastern State Penitentiary at
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It’s Editors, or the Institution itself, cannot be held responsible for
plagiarism. The contents of the magazine are not copyrighted unless indicated, and permission to
reprint any material in this issue is cordially granted.

Dear Reader:

If you are a regular
reader, you know ECHO
has a new look. Like mi-
lady’s coiffure or dad’s
new lawn and landscap-
ing, such things don’t
‘‘just happen’’. They
must be carefully learn-
ed, experimentally tried,
continually improved
and ‘bettered. Magazine
layout is largely a mat- ~
ter of taste and expe-
dients designed to corral
reader interest. There
are tricks of the trade,
so to speak, and lacking
that knowledge the staff
of this magazine is
gratefully indebted to
many persons for their
constructive suggestions
and criticisms. Partic-
ularly we wish to thank:
the gentleman from...
Gettysburg College, I
believe; Don Lowry, of
Southern Michigan
SPECTATOR fame;
Werner Scharzmiller, of
the Colorado RECOUNT;
Mr. Robert L. Voorhees,
of the POST-STAND-
ARD, Syracuse, New
York (excerpts from
whose letters are re-
printed in our MAIL
BAG column); Ray
Whittaker, Advisor,
Temple University Pub-
lications, and the young
men of the Temple U.
Journalism Fraternity,
who took time to visit
with us and discuss our
technical problems.

Content-wise we es-
pecially invite your at-
tention in this issue to
G. Stewart’s graphic
presentation of a _ sen-
tencing system  origi-
nated by this young in-
mate.

On P-14, Louis J.
Biancone analyses The
Universal Penal Prob-
lem and concludes that
incentive benefits must
play a part in any genu-
ine solution.

For the Echo Record,
P-7, provides some of
the most eye - opening
statistics ever printed in
the pages of our maga-
zine. They should be
a revelation to all of us.
