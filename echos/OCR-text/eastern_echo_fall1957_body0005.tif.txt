CAGE ONE

An editorial

All men are not criminals. Nor do they expect to become so. For surely
the sound moral values and attitudes held by most men would seem to preclude
the chance of their ever falling into criminal behavior.

Nevertheless...it is a valid point that all men have within themselves
and in the possibility of circumstance, the capacity for crime. That but for the
grace of God, just two minutes away in the life of any man is an act which can
send him to prison.

Unthinkable?

In a socially accepted manner of speaking, yes. But from a religious per-
spective the truth of this point may be seen. If seen as true, it must become
thinkable.

We hope this deeper truth may one day be fully recognized. For its wide-
spread acceptance might just result in a general increase in humility. And
humble men tend to look upon their fallen neighbors in a light free of con-
demnation. In the chain of relations, social condemnation forms the body of
the felon’s disgrace—one of the greatest obstacles in the path of his reform.
Nothing is more demoralizing. With the impulse to condemn washed away,
such humility might reach and filter through the felon’s world, dissolve one
obstacle, and help him change himself.

Unthinkable?
