So you don’t believe there is a God? Well
some scant satisfaction must be yours in the
knowledge that you don’t stand alone in your
skepticism. However now that you are treading
on my toes (my page) pull up a chair and let’s sit
down and have a comfortable gab session.

I’m reminded of an incident that took place the
other night in the basement of John Jacob’s home.

“Do you see that automatic washer over
there?” John asked Kenneth Miller. “Let me
tell you an interesting story about it.”

“Mary had always wanted an automatic
washer. 1 conceived the idea of purchasing an old
tub, a few bolts, several screws, a number of gears,
etc. I placed them there over night. The next
morning when we came downstairs abbacadaba!
there she was, this sleek beauty you see standing
before you. It’s perfectly timed for washing,
rinsing, and drying and neatly geared to run just
the right number of cycles to finish each perfectly.”

Ken Miller knew that John was ribbing him.
He further knew just why John was doing it. They
had been standing there in the basement debating
the existence of God. Ken insisted that no one
could prove it, but John felt pretty sure he could.

And so he pointed to the automatic washer as
the closest illustration. At just the right moment
the machine would feed the water; at just the right
moment it would transfer the suds to an adjoining
tub, at precisely the proper time it would douse the
clothes with rinse water; at just the right time it
would spin the clothes and dry them; and at just the
right time it would shut itself off.

How come? Surely, not because John had
seized an old tub, bolts, screws, nuts, gears, etc. and
stacked them in a remote corner of the cellar. He
could have let them stand in that corner till King-
dom Come, and all he would have had was a tub,
some bolts, screws, nuts, gears, etc. and no automa-
tic washer.

There must have been something more to ex-
plain that marvelous mechanism. There must have
been a mind to conceive the inter-relation of the
sundry delicate parts. There must have been a
moving power to set itself to the task of putting
these parts together so they would do exactly what
the originator intended.

In other words, washing machines just don't
happen. There must be a superintending intelli-

gence to plan and skillful hands to construct them.

Now, if this is true of an ordinary washing ma-
chine, how much more must it be true of the great
universe in which we live with its regular cycles of
light and darkness, heat and cold, sunshine and
rain, seedtime and harvest!

Surely there was nothing wrong with John’s
logic. Think of several of the marvels of God's
creative handiwork. This universe of ours is per-
fectly timed. Our almanacs will predict the cycles
of the seasons, the sunrises, the sunsets, the phases
of the moon, and solar and lunar eclipses. I have
before me the Almanac for 1952——poor preachers
can never afford to be up to date. I note that al-
though printed in the latter part of 1951 it, never-
theless declares with undeviating accuracy, the as-
tronomical phenomena for the year 1952. It states,
for example, that in September, Venus sets at 7:22
P.M., September Ist., and at 6:49 P.M. September
30th. The planet is moving southward rapidly and
each night sets farther south of west. It passes the
star Spica September 2Ist. It passes the planet
Saturn September 15th. Mars sets at 10:01 P.M.
September Ist., and at 9:19 P.M. September 30th.
At the middle of the month it is of magnitude 0.5.
Jupitor rises at 9:30 P.M. September Ist., and at
7:34 P.M., September 30th. The satellites will be
interesting on the morning of September 4th. Three
of them will be out of sight simultaneously from
2:38 A.M. until 3:58 A.M. It starts the westward
motion September 9th. Saturn sets at 8:02 A.M.,
September Ist., and at the end of the month it is too
nearly in the direction of the Sun for observation
The Sun crosses the Equator on September 22nd., at
9:24 P.M. Autumn commences at that time.

Queer isn’t it that our almanacs are never
wrong? No it isn’t queer at all, no queerer than the
fact that John’s wife can stand in front of her auto-
matic washer and tell her friends just exactly what's
going to happen.

Behind every washer stands the man that built
it and behind every rolling sphere, every changing
season, every sunrise and sunset, stands God.

If there is a God; and nature and scripture de-
clares there is, how does He feel toward us? What
are His intentions for our future? Not in the book
of nature, but in the Book of Books do we find the
only satisfying answers to these questions.
