Reformation or Rehabilitation

Father John J. McHugh

Advanced penologists realize that it is futile to
simply incarcerate an offender without equipping him
to take his place in free society upon release. Conse-
quently, vocational rehabilitation—the theme of the cur-
rent issue of Echo—plays a major part in the correc-
tional process. :

However, it is no secret that the rate of recidivism
is on the increase so, obviously, present techniques
of treatment have not been fully effective and leave
much to be desired. Many excuses have been purport-
ed for this failure, among them the lack of qualified
Although these
may be valid reasons (certainly this old prison in

personnel, improper facilities, etc.

Philadelphia is outmoded) the basic principle in refor-
mation—that of forming character by self-discipline—
has been neglected or ignored and undue emphasis has
been placed on mere palliatives.

Schools, shops and hospitals have their proper place
in the development of the whole man but a person is
not convicted of a crime because he is illiterate, un-
skilled or physically handicapped. These may be con-
tributing factors of deviate behavior, but a man is sent
to prison because he allegedly violated a law designed
to protect the life orjustly acquired property of another.
The right to life and property is vested in the natural
and Divine law and any invasion of this right is not
only anoffense against the law of the state but usually
against the Law of God. From this it follows that the
primary concern in any treatment program should be an

evaluation of moral principles. This can be accom-
plished, in part, by a well ordered religious program
free from irrelevant restrictions peculiar to some penal

institutions.

The responsibility of character guidance should not
rest entirely with the chaplains. The security force
and the treatment staff have an equal obligation to help
the offender face his problems squarely, recognize the
rights of others, and attain maturity. An honest ap-
proach should be made to bring the offender to the
realization that it is no disgrace to make a mistake
provided the mistake is acknowledged and corrected.

It is not enough to determine the reasons why an
offense was committed—sometimes these reasons serve
as excuses. The core lies in a treatment program
whereby a person is taught that he is a creature of God
endowed with free will and responsible for his actions.
If he is not responsible then he is incapable of com-
mitting a culpable act and, in justice, does not belong
in prison.

Spiritual Growth

Rev. Nathaniel Williams

Spiritual growth will be in proportion to the attitude
we hold in relation to the Word of God.
