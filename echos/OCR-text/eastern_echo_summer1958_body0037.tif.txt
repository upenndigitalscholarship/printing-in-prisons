Chess Match with Temple Ends in Draw

If there were ever any doubts about the quality
of chess players within these walls, such doubts were
dissolved as our chess club played host to a form-
idable five-man team representing Temple Univer-
sity.

As our players assembled in the Annex, to await
the arrival of Temple’s team, they appeared tense
and nervous. Perhaps they were apprehensive—
surely a human reaction on such an unprecedented
oceasion. The tension was broken by an exhibition
chess game played by Dr. Morello versus Mr.
Birremby, “ina, “°classmes” suemegle loemicem lien
ment and Custody was one that sponsored a few wide
grins. Unfortunately, the results cannot be reported
because the contest defies description.

With the arrival of the Temple team, the op-
ponents were paired at five chess boards. Introduc-
tions were completed and the room settled into an air
of quiet excitement as play began.

At board number 1 Marty Pearson was opposed
by Jack Stevens, a Math. major and Senior at
Temple. The game continued for three hours, but
after 53 moves Marty was forced to resign and
Temple had a win.

At board number 2 Thomas Brawner gave
Eastern a win with a brilliant trap. His opponent
Harvey Alter, a Junior Math. major at Temple, re-
signed after 11 moves.

Board number 3 featured Mike Quinn versus
Doctor Sidney Axinn, head of the Philosophy De-
partment at Temple. Mike is a guy with plenty of
mileage on a chess board and he proved it in the
game that also decided the match. It was declared
a draw by mutual consent after 36 moves.

At board number 4 William K. Hallowell re-
signed after 19 moves. His opponent was Bill Gins-
berg, a graduate student in Teaching. Ginsberg
taught Hallowell plenty as he posted a win for
Temple.

Board number 5 had Bill Palmer opposed by
Darwin Loigman, a Senior in Temple’s Business
College. Palmer gave Eastern a second win as he
put Loigman out of business with a checkmate in
31 moves.

Midway in the evening an intermission was de-
clared while coffee and cake was served. Mr. Brierly
drew a big laugh as he announced pseudo-sternly,
“Tf Temple wins they will have trouble at the gate.’’

EASTERN EcHo

each team having two wins, two losses and one

pubhie relations and is looking forward to further
