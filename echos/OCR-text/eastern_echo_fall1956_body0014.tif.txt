All of us who have had occasion to visit 3rd
block at any time must have observed that mad-
looking person who leers from the doorway of the
laboratory. That’s my fren’ Irvin 8 ----- (a hint,
his surname is synonymous with fat, obese, cor-
pulent, which until the time he began to diet de-
seribed him perfectly). I first met my fren’ Irvin
when we were both youngsters. He had often in-
vited me up to his home to see his chemistry set.
(Come to think of it, you know, he never did show
me his chemistry set.) We drifted apart as boys
do and I met him again when I arrived here. It
, was during my quarantine period, at the time I
was sent to the Lab for my shots. As I approached
the Lab I could hear someone saying, “ - -- took all
kinds of prizes. Watch this shot.’’ I looked into
the Lab and there stood a fellow with his pants at
half-mast with a target painted on his buttock and
standing across the room from him stood my fren’
Irvin, with his back turned to the fellow, peering at
him through a hand mirror and in his other hand
was poised a syringe which he flicked over his
shoulder with a deft movement of his wrist. Boy!
that shot must have taken a lot of practice, a perfect
bull’s eye! I rushed into the Lab and congratulated
my fren’ and insisted that he do the same trick
with me as a target. But, he looked at me through
haggard eyes and a drawn face and sad, “Joe, ole’
buddy, I can’t. It takes too much out of me.’’ Just
then the recent target spoke up and said, ‘‘Fine,
now take this glass dart out of me.’”’

It’s interesting and educational to just sit and
chat with my fren’ Irvin. I especially enjoy his
explaining the different specimens that are contained
in the sealed jars. He showed me one that he call-
ed, ‘‘roaches of the liver’’. Much to my chagrin
I tried to correct him by saying, ‘‘Don’t you mean
cirrhosis of the Liver?’’ He raised himself to his
entire 5’8’’ and looked up his nose at me (well, he
could hardly look down his nose at me, I’m 6’1’’)
and seathingly replied, ‘‘Sir, I mean roaches of the
Liver.’’ Whereupon he thrust the jar into my
hands and, sure enough, there were two roaches in
the jar with the Liver. Once he was showing me the
Diathermy Machine, the Cardiograph Machine and
a couple of other impressive machines and the dia-
logue that time was full of ‘‘short-wave’’, ‘‘cathode
rays’’, ‘‘pay rays’’ and ‘‘ultra-violet rays’’.

I marvelled at the equipment that is displayed
in the laboratory and I remarked to him that they
seemed prepared to cope with any sickness that
eould, or would dare, to enter the institution and
attack our population. He scoffed at this remark

and told me that many times he had to use equip-
ment and medications that were not to be found in
medical supplies directories. He took me to one
of the far cabinets and, after removing a desk from
the front of it, reached down and opened one of
the doors of the cabinets and there amidst an ac-
cumulation of dust and cobwebs were an array of
bottles labeled with such items as, Scum from a
Stagnant Millpond; Left Toes of a a Horned Owl;
Lizard Bone Dust; Hair from the Dog that Bit Me
(I was familiar with that one, but he wouldn’t let
me sample it); Scrapings from under the Finger-
nails, ete., ete. Also included was an amount of red
wax and lying upon it was a tiny figure in the form
of aman. I was amazed! Stunned! This smacked
of Sorcery; Witchcraft! My amazement must have
been apparent for he gripped my arm and made me
take an oath to keep his secret. (So, okay, 1 prom-
ised to keep his secret but my first obligation is to
fill this magazine with words.) He told me con-
fidentially that all hospitals and laboratories keep
a supply of these items as a last resort. He further
stated that it is now being brought into the open,
but first they had to compile new names for some
of the things that I saw on the labels of the bottles.
Some of these things are now called, Streptomiasn,
Aureomiasn, Penisillen, Isoniadiz, and of course,
Aspirin. (Spelling of drugs, courtesy of George
“‘Blumberg’’) Most of the leading hospitals of our
country are staffed with at least one Sorcerer. Deep
in the bowels of the hospitals, in an inaccessible
corner, can be found the Sorcerer at his steaming
pot, stirring, continuously stirring.

I watched my fren’ Irvin conduct many ex-
periments and he even let me peer through his
microscope once. (Not what I thought it would be,
though. J had in mind those novel rings that were
the rage years ago. The kind that had a little
hole into which you could peep. Remember??)
It’s clever the way they draw the blood into the
pipettes to get a specimen. I once tried that while
siphoning gas from a tank—UGH! Food didn’t
taste good for weeks. One afternoon I walked
down to the Lab to pass the time of day with my
fren’ Irvin and as I entered I saw that he was
conducting what appeared to be an interesting ex-
periment. He had a pipette in his mouth and I
could see that he was drawing from a glass beaker
which was filled with a frothy, milky mass. When
he saw me he began to draw more heavily from the
beaker and, it appeared, more hurriedly. I stood
there, silently observing, for he had often warned
me not to interrupt while he was conducting any
tests or experiments. As I stood there I became
curious, for rather than stopping or removing the
pipette when it filled he seemed to be swallowing
it. This certainly was unusual. After he had drained
the beaker, I asked him, startled, ‘‘Irvin, ole’ boy,
what are you doing, running a test?’’ ‘‘Test?
Heck no,’’ he replied. ‘‘I wanted to suck up this ice
cream soda before you bummed me for any.’’ Hmm!
My fren’ Irvin!
