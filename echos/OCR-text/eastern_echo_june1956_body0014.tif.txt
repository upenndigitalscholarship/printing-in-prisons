retaining a well-balanced outlook on

On November 8, 1920 a man was sentenced to
life imprisonment. He entered the Hastern State;

Penitentiary on November 20, 1920 as inmate

40-535. Today this man is the oldest prisoner in
this Commonwealth in continuous time served.

When a man has spent 35 years and 7 months
in prison and retains his facilities for free and
enterprising thought, this writer feels we should
all take notice and lend an attentive ear. For
this is his story and these are his ideas and thoughts.
It simply fell to me to write it and I feel a bit
richer for having done so.

‘‘When I first came in here, back in 1920,
Warden Kenny was warden. My first thought
was, ‘Well here I am, I can’t go in the street, so
I’ll make the best of it.’ I noticed then there were
no towers for the guards, just shacks in each corner
of the wall to keep them out of the bad weather.

‘I was examined down front and taken to 4
Gallery. It was receiving then. There weren’t any
classification tests or anything like that. For three
weeks I sat around in quarantine before I went
into population. Back then we were out from 8
o’clock in the morning until 4 o’clock in the
evening. There wasn’t much work and I wasn’t
given a job. We played ball if we wanted to or
just sat around. In those days the fellows had
canaries or parakeets in cages in their cells. During
the day they’d hang the cages out on the blocks. I
work in the cells: they made watch fobs, bracelets
and bead bags; a man kept busy if he wanted too.
You know, in the old days we had visits on the
blocks. The clothes room or first cell was used
for visits. A guard sat outside while your visit
was in with you, to make sure. Back when Warden
Smith was here we had outside shows, even girl
shows came in. That was during the silent movies
and they were held on the block. I don’t remember
about the schools here in those days; you know it’s
been so long. ‘Kangaroo Court’ was held nearly
every day over where the Chaplain’s office used to
be. They gave a guy a ‘lawyer’, but it didn’t do
no good.

“Things tightened up here in 1923, discipline
became stricter. Then in 1927, work began on 14
block. Jobs were open to the boys then. I suppose
some think that when the women prisoners were
here, things were closed more for the men. Well,
it wasn’t that way, we had the big yard and they
had the yard by 2 block where they locked. They
just stepped out of their cells into the yard. It
didn’t hamper us a bit.

‘‘Since 1932 things have changed. In the old
12

life sprinkled with humor and wisdom.

-days when I came in they had about 28 or 30 dogs

down where the green house is now and back into
that alley there. They used to feed all the meat
to them. Of course you could buy things then,
cheese by the pound, eggs by the dozen, if you had
the money. I think things now though are far
better. You have priviliges now you didn’t have
then. You can go to school for mechanical drawing,
sign lettering; inmates are employed and make a
little cash. Then they have pins, too. Nowadays
they have a Behavior Clinie and men get a chance
The food is better and more of it. J remember when
they had the boxing ring here, over by the Chapel.
Each morning at eight o’clock men headed to
watch the grudge fights. After the fight they had
to shake and let it go at that. This Treatment
Clinic is the biggest step, I think in the time I’ve
been here. If I was to compare, I’d say the new
system is better than the old. It was tough in the
old days, real tough. This now is a chance for the
boys to help themselves, more than ever since I’ve
been here. There’ve been a lot of changes. Why,
I remember when the Board of Directors used to
listen to grievances and your problems.

‘‘But, the changes are good. They have helped
greatly. Now they try to guide you into a useful
channel. Back before, there weren’t any facilities
for useful jobs and studies. Today, I think, it’s
more rehabilitation, rather than punishment. It’s
been slow, but I feel it would have been better
if the boys had behaved themselves. Before the
trouble you could get magazines, newspapers from
all over the country, radios in the cells and morris
chairs. Then, nothing.

“‘Now the hospital is advanced, too. It’s nice,
I think. The doctors seem to be efficient and they
treat me all right. I’m feeling fairly well now.
I remember when they had a male nurse here from
the outside.

‘“Tt’s one bad thing I think they do. Not here,
but outside. They send these young fellows 14,
15 and 16 years old here. They shouldn’t be here.
In a reformatory yes, but not here. Give them 1
to 5 for something not very serious or maybe 5 to
10 if it’s bad. But don’t send them here. All in all
though, the good changes are fine. It’s a great
difference from then and now.”’

This is from a man 72 years old, awaiting
serious surgery; and his sight is nearly complete-
ly gone. Yet, he’s sharp mentally, not cynical in

his outlook even after so long a period of incarcer-
ation. This all began in 1920.

And this is 1956.
