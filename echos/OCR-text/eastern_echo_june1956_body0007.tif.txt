MR. I.C.S. RETIRES

AFTER 20 YEARS OF MERITORIOUS

AND UNSELFISH SERVICE
TO INMATES

We note in the April edition of the Iowa State
Penitentiary ‘‘Presidio’’ that Tom Runyon has with
an exclusive interview scooped the Echo in his
article entitled ‘‘You Never Forget the Men Out
There.’? We say scooped because the man Runyon
describes as a slight, quiet-spoken bachelor who has
literally ‘‘covered the waterfront as far as service
to prisons is concerned”, initiated that service at
Eastern. For it was Eastern inmates who were the
first to benefit under the non-profit venture de-
veloped back in 1936 and known as the ICS.
Prison Cooperative Plan. And that Plan was found-
ed and serviced and brought to E.S.P. by the man
Runyon interviewed, Ray Barbour.

You perhaps are wondering, ‘‘So who is Ray
Barbour and what’s with this Cooperative Plan?”’

It may be that Barbour is little known out-
side our schoolrooms but if his policy of ‘‘no pub-
licity’’, broken only for penal press upon his retire-
ment March 31st, 1956 as Field Secretary of Inter-
national Correspondence Schools,—if this policy had
not been in effect during the 20 years of his prison
work, you and a large segment of the population of
AT other states would know of him first and fore-
most as a good will ambassador for prisoners. This
man who moves about on state and federal levels
has been a behind-the-scenes but outspoken friend
of the man behind bars, not only before parole and
pardon boards but in prisons and business circles
as well.

As for his Cooperative Plan, Runyon tells us
that Barbour conceived the idea in 1936. At that
time one of his duties was, on a national level, to
supervise the processing of I.C.S. correspondence
studies subscribed to by inmates. In the course of
his work he evolved the Cooperative arrangement
under which inmates may take courses without the
usual fee. The acceptance of this setup mushroomed
in time across American prisons until presently
there are 60 prisons and reformatories where I.C.S.
courses are available. In a survey conducted in
1955, and again according to Runyon, 3,728 inmate-
students were then currently enrolled. In this over-
all operation of this Plan 6,650 diplomas have been
issued to inmates.

As previously stated, Barbour actually pio-
neered his venture here at this institution. Under
the system as we know it, books from courses
selected by the Educational Director are purchased

at cost with monies from the Prisoners’ Welfare
Fund and are loaned to inmate-students. In ad-
dition, other courses not offered through the institu-
tion have been purchased, at discount, direct from
I.C.S. home offices by those interested. Our first
student was William Henry Horn, a fellow who
went to the mat with the now discontinued Live-
stock Course, completing it in 1937 with diploma.
Since this early beginning, the number of diplomas
earned by men at Hastern has reached amazing
proportions.

We are becoming accustomed to reading arti-
eles in our local papers which picture Hastern
prisoners in an unwarranted light of straining to
get back into society for the sole purpose of com-
mitting the same crimes again for which they were
incarcerated. For the benefit of any interested
local editor who might get to read this issue, and so
that he will have something concrete to place be-
side his present opinion of us, let us state the
actual diploma statistics and proportions involved :

In the 20 years in which the I.C.S. Prison
Cooperative Plan has been in operation over the
prisons of the country:

otal inmate-carmed= diplomas = 2-5 —== == === == 6,650
Earned by inmates at Eastern (since separation) - 35
Earned by inmates at Eastern (with Farm) ------ Holla
Earned by inmates at Farm (since separation) -. 111
Total of Eastern diplomas (Farm and H.S.P.) ~-- 1,317

Which means that we inmates, instead of using
our prison leisure hours to plot new crime, have
among other worthwhile things been busily earning
approximately one-fifth of the total number of
diplomas granted under the I.C.S. Prison Plan.
And let me repeat, this total of 6,650 is not a state-
wide figure but a national one against which the
1,317 is compared.

We believe this record is well worth anyone’s
knowing. It is made possible through Ray Barbour
and J.C.S. as cooperating agency with the institu-
tion. It is the fulfillment of his brain-child and a
tribute to the effort and industry of Eastern inmates.
As Mr. Barbour retires, let him keep the memory
of this record to lay beside the many other ‘“‘high
points’’ of his prison career as a measure of what
inmates of a major penitentiary can do and will do
in response to a helping hand.

And may he always remember proudly that
his was the helping hand.
