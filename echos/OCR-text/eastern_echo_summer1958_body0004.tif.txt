With few exceptions does anyone move ahead in life without working hard, having certain goals in
view. It is not wrong to say a man may keep his thoughts in the clouds but at the same time he must
keep his feet on the ground.

To enjoy life, one must put forth effort and not expect something for nothing. Too often men
prefer to take short cuts or give up quickly when energy or work must be expended. If a man enrolls in
a course of study here, the mere turning of pages will not absorb knowledge. A man must try to under-
stand what he reads. The same is true in many phases of activity here. Men become impatient when
they do not receive what they think is their rignt. Some become rude when things do not fall into
place as they think—even if it is wrong, unreasonable and improper. This points to lack of maturity
and makes one wonder if the man is ready to cope with problems of free society that everyone has.

Everyone will agree the answer to everything can’t be “yes’”—there would be chaos in the world
were that the case. No one will dispute that rules and regulations are necessary in every walk of life,
in every community no matter where.

One just can’t vegetate or sleep away his opportunities. He must make every day count and per-
form constructively. If nothing is put forward, nothing comes back. If he doesn’t, he finally reaches
and arrives at an important phase of his life and when asked what he has accomplished he can’t answer.
Something can’t be created from nothing. A man knows all this but the regrettable part is that he
does nothing about it but blames everyone else for his shortcomings and deficiencies. The matter of
release from prison is a good example. The whole concept is to prepare a man for release by social-
izing, re-socializing and education or by whatever term is appropriate. All prison publications affirm
this. To dispute this is the very negation of modern penology. Somewhere | read, “Faith without good
works is meaningless.” Here too mere writing, thinking or talking means nothing. A man is known
by his proper actions.

Sir William Blackstone, one of the greatest legal writers of all times wrote of a third point of im-
prisonment and that is reformation. We constantly write and try to convince our public of this and
when those vitally involved in criminal process begin to fully understand this, society will profit immeas-
urably and perhaps give a helping hand to the unfortunate even after release providing, of course, the
offender exhibits a sincere desire to prove his worthiness and make constructive use of his time. We
must rid ourselves of the obsession that the criminal’s guilt found or acknowledged absolves society from
the possibility of positive regenerative treatment. We say that such a course will require extensive
education not only of the public generally, but all concerned in this very important part. Let's measure
up to what we preach!
