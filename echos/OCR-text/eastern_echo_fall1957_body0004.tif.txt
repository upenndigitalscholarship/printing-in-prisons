From the Warden's Desk:

Over the years I have read many articles on cause of crime. Some were
heavy tomes, some were frivolous; some were authored by persons who had
no experience in penal affairs and most by persons who have not felt what
the offender has. Most have overlooked the basic reason—society itself, in
what is known as the mores.

The people today are concerned primarily with the material things of
life—money, affluence, power. The finer, cultural things of life are over-
looked; things that make for fullness and meaning in life, including honesty,
integrity and humility. That has been evident on quiz programs, which
proved that 90% of the American people have little knowledge of history,
philosophy and why we are on this mortal coil.

People today will sacrifice anything to purchase worldly goods. The
children are secondary. Parents are more concerned with their own pleasure
than concentrating on raising children properly, giving them love, affection,
guidance and discipline. Kids run the street and get into trouble. Where
are the parents? Busy making money and seeking pleasure, not for and with
the kids but for their own satisfaction. Everybody is trying to curb juvenile
delinquency. Let’s call it adult delinquency. It is more fitting! Until
people realize this, the delinquency rate will rise. Crime in later years will
inerease. People choose to ignore these fundamental facts. It will take
as long to correct in each case as it did to reach the breaking point. People
say, ““It can’t happen to me.’’ But it invariably does.

People give excellent lip service but in practice are only concerned with
themselves—the devil with the rights of others.

As Erle Stanley Gardner recently wrote, ‘‘I feel the prison of tomorrow
will have the type of work to develop character. Few know what caused
them to go to prison in the first place and the treatment society gives them
over a period of years is such that many of them have virtually no choice
but to return to prison.”’

If a man shows a genuine desire to adjust, why does society expect more
of him than those who live ‘‘normal’’ lives?

Our efforts have advanced tremendously compared with 100, 50, 25 or even
10 years ago. Comparisons (usually odious) point this up sharply. Yet...

Hrasmus, a profound thinker in the 15th century, wrote, ‘‘I intend to
preach reason and mutual forebearance, and when you have finished cutting
each other’s throats for theories neither of you can prove right or wrong, you
will perhaps listen how to live happily with each other instead of forever
carting your opponents to the gallow and wheel.”’

In “‘In Praise of Folly’’ he wrote, as Voltaire later did, ‘‘Since the human
race insists upon being completely crazy, of high and low station in life; since
the whole world has firmly set its heart against using its God-given brain
but insists upon letting itself be entirely guided by greed, vanity, and
ignorance, why in the name of a reasonable Deity should the few truly great
men waste so much time in their effort to change the human race into some-
thing it never wanted to be? Let them be happy in their follies—don’t
deprive them of that which gives them more satisfaction than anything else—
the sovereign power to make fools of themselves.’’

How do we fit this broadside?
Live honestly.
Hurt no man.
Render everyone his due.
