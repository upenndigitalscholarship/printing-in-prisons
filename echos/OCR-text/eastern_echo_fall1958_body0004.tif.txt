From the Superintendent's Desk:

The following is a portion of a speech delivered by Mr. Banmiller before the Pennsylvama
Prison Society, May 5, 1958.

Needless to say, as you all know there is much misunderstanding and misconception of prison and
regrettably society and even those in high office lose sight of our purpose.

In terms of years, not so long ago when separate and solitary confinement at hard labor was the
philosophy it was comparatively easy. The predecessor of this very organization did much to alleviate the
miseries of the offender at the turn of the 19th century. Prior to that prisons for confinement were
unknown. History proved that severity never solved the problem of crime nor cured the nature of the
criminal. There were many capital offenses and it seemed the more brutal the punishment the more
bloodthirsty society became; disemboweling, quartering, drawing, burning and other punishments just
as gory were the vogue. Violence seemed to beget violence !

But as time went on and society finally realized the offender was a human being there began the
late realization that perhaps there was such a thing as reformation.

Is it proper, civilized and Christian to cast a man into prison without some plan for rehabilitation?
At most it is a simple answer to rid society of a troublesome person. However, society must realize that
most of these people will be released. Will they be better or worse ? To deny that every opportunity
should be given to resocialize the offender and to change his attitudes is a ridiculous proposition.
However, in so-called enlightened quarters this unfortunately is a prevalent theory.

Is not the offender the very product of the society that breeds such characteristics or mores that
have developed with materialism, with disregard for morality, with tne renunciation of responsibility
of parents to the child. Upon viewing this entire matter and picture, it represents nothing more than a
vicious circle that reflects on the weakness of our own society. This includes something for nothing,
love of easy money, contempt for authority and disregard for the rights of others.

If perhaps, as Sir William Blackstone said, ‘There was a certainty of punishment for all there would
be less hiding behind influence with consequent contempt for law.’” Law represents nothing more than
a nation’s sense of morality. Let’s start on two truisms:

(1) Noone doubts the erudition of Sir William Blackstone. It is very clearly stated by him that
imprisonment is to serve three purposes:

(a) As and not for punishment.
(b) As a deterrent to others.
(c) To reform the offender.

This was written nearly two hundred years ago, therefore, our role in prison is very clear - to
reform, resocialize or whatever you wish to call it, the convicted.

(2) The way the convicted men are handled in prison determines their attitudes and preparation
to resume their place in free society. Let us, therefore, establish the ground work for ‘A program for the
convicted,”
