Using a free-wheeling fast break, Shakey Youngs’
Warriors ran roughshod over the rest of the league
and wound up the season with an amazing record of
twenty-three wins and only three defeats. The dom-
inance of this team was due to the spark that each
man seemed to set in his fellow player. The men that
kept the Warriors at the top were, Billy Holley, cer-
tainly the best all-around player in the league, Al
Shep, the man with the shooting arm, Jack Haas, a
superlative defensive player and the leagues leading
rebounder, Shakey, who is a tough competitor,
“Crazy” Herb, a stickout on defense, Sonny Mays,
Art Pfrommer, Joe Joe, Cueball and the old pro, Sam
Simmoniti. Little Mack was the strategist behind this
fine championship team while your reporter was the
teams bad boy, never showing for a scheduled game.
Did they really need me?

Norman Pearsons’ Barons won out for the runner-
up slot with Blackie Battles being the heart and soul
of the starting five. Cochise Bell was the most im-
proved player around with Lomax giving a tussle for
the scoring and rebounding honors. Two rookies,
”»Preacher“ and “Lurk” Baity gave a good account
of themselves. The Barons finished with a 15 and 16
won and lost record but should have done a lot better.

In third place the Vandals, under the guidance of
“Juice” Cohen, took 9 games while losing 16. The
team had a strong starting five and good bench ma-
terial but seemed to lack desire. Elijah Sheperd has
the toughest jump shot in the league and while
they’re not the fastest men around, Dave Croxton,
John Wheeler, Stonewall, and Chuck stick like glue
on defense. Sam Brown and Willie Green were called

up from the One Block League to add to the team’s
efforts and gave a good account of themselves as did
Fleming and Sharkey. Again, another team that
should have had a better record.

After a consultation with the staff, Tuffy Wright
decided to relinquish the managership of his team as
he went on vacation and John O’Brien took over.
“O’Bie” had a tough job even holding this team to-
eether and wound up with a disappointing record of
7 wins and nineteen defeats. Jake was the big gun
for the vagabonds and played his usual cool game.
Bill Barnes had a tough season and couldn’t seem to
get unwound until the late stages. Massanova and
Joe Antonowiletez gave their all while little Juice was
a pleasant surprise with his rebounding. However,
the efforts of these players weren’t enough as the
Vagabonds finished fourth, despite the Echo’s predic-
tion of their winning the crown.

EASTERN LEAGUE PLAYOFFS

The fourth place Vagabonds started a drive to the
top by knocking off the Vandals in two consecutive
games in a best-of-three series. It looked as though
O’Bie finally had his team moving.

In the next round of play-offs, a best of five series,
O’Briens Vagabonds walked away with the first game
and were leading in the second when yard-out ended.
However a protest by the Barons was given sanction,
and in a protest to this decision, the Vagabonds con-
ceded the rest of their games to the Barons.

The first place Warriors showed their power by
smashing the Barons in the championship playoffs
with four straight wins in the best-of-seven series.
