GENERAL ELECTRIC vs
CHERRY HILL ALL-STARS
by Charles M. Tobin

The game began at 2:00 P.M. sharp. But, as
far as the institution was concerned, it started on the
6th day of January, 1958 .. . that being the date
Athletic Director, Mr. Thomas H. Graham and Mr.
John Doyle, Custodial Officer, announced the inten-
tion of bringing in outside basketball competition.

Under the management of Horace Wright and
coached by Little Mack, the All-Star Team, com-
prised of 13 players, worked out a series of plays
with determination seasoned with a touch of anxiety.

On the morning of March 29, the All-Stars were
as ready as they would ever be. This would be the
big test! Could they hold their own against the out-
siders?

Remarks filled the air prior to the introduction
of the General Electric Shop League squad:

‘‘T think the outsiders will prove more scien-
tific, more experienced .. .”’

‘“T don’t know about that,’’ remarked another.
‘Tyon’t underestimate the inside. After all, they
are used to playing on this dirt court, whereas the
outside fellows are accustomed to hardwood and
eement floors ...”’

‘““The outside will win,’’ stated a staunch heck-
ler, ‘‘because the inside don’t know how to play to-
gether as a team and, besides, I think we have too
“many players.’’

Well... now we would see!

The starting five for General Electric were:
Ed Doyle, Ed McCullough, Jim Quick, Gallagher and
Devlin.

Hor ene Adieevars: harold = Meeny 2 Berry.
Charles Adderly, Harry Fricker, John  ~ Obie’
O’Brien and Harry ‘‘Juice’’ Cohen.

Officiating: Stan Hummer (Outside) and Julius
Griffin (Inside).

The contest got off to a very slow start. It
somewhat reminded one of a squared-circle match;
each participant feeling out the weakpoints of his
opponent. Charles Adderly scored the first field
goal with a short hook mid-way up the key. The
cheers from the side-lines seemed to make both teams
come to life. William Howard replaced Cohen and
quickly scored two field goals on fast breaks. Gall-
agher, for General Electric, immediately took the
spotlight by scoring six points from thirty feet
out... only to have Howard come back with two
more lay-ups.

At half-time the score was tied, 12-12.

Starting the second half, it was Adderly once
again to score the first field goal with a one-hand
push-shot from 8 feet to the left of his basket. The
Cherry Hill squad was now ready to open up with
their big guns. But the GE five began to move the
ball, scoring from inside and out, staying right with
the All-Stars. Devlin, Gallagher and Doyle showed
pro form, however, the stars were not to be out-
classed. Jimmy Morrison, Drake and Fricker proved
their equal with a beautiful exhibition of dribbling
and passing off. At one stage of the game the ball
was stolen three successive times, which brought
the spectators to their feet applauding and cheer-
ing both teams.

The score remained close all the way, when with
four minutes remaining, the All-Stars spurted to a
seven point lead. With one minute left in the
game, the lead was cut to three points, 47-44. The
General Electric boys gained possession of the ball
and called time-out with only 20 seconds to go.
Their plan was set for one of their key players to
drive in for a shot, trying to draw a foul... and it
worked. Fitzgerald drove in, backed off and shot,
drawing a foul by ‘‘Teeny’’ Berry. The shot was
good, making the score 47-46. Fitzgerald now had
a chance to tie the game from the foul line. Only
four seconds remained on the clock. A hush settled
over the crowd as he toed the line .. . took a deep
breath (like you see on T.V.) ... it’s up... around
the rim .... NO GOOD!)

The Stars took the rebound and the game was
over. Cherry Hill had won, 47-46. The crowd went:
wild!

To this writer, it was more than a victory. It
was clean sportsmanship on both sides, a stepping
stone toward better public relations and better
understanding between two groups of people,—
prisoners and free men—who, in reality, are really
one. It proved beneficial to all and embarassing to
no one.
