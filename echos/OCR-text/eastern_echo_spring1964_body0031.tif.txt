Maestro Giacinto Vizoca, conducted
the Institutional Band while waiting for
the guests to arrive and woke the audi-
torium up once with a lively “El Castil-
lero.’ In brief, the band gave us a very
professional performance.

Mr. Pete Byrone was introduced by
Mr. Thomas Graham, Director of Treat-
ment, to M. C. for the evening. Pete
Byrone, known throughout the state for
his able sports announcing, took the
reins and proceeded to introduce the
array of guests. Mr. Byrone known
quite well by the men in this institution,
kept the speakers moving and the audi-
ence in good spirits.

Joe Sweeney, (the former Veteran’s
Boxing Association President) with a
dead pan seriousness, took the rostrum
in both hands as though he were about
to either fight or preach; but suddenly
his Irish smile emanated and brought
forth a wierd collection of anecdotes.
Mr. Sweeney, a former guest of ours,
told of some of his experiences in the
ring—both as a fighter and referee, and
the fortunate station he honors as being
one of the oldest referees in the busi-
ness. Paradoxically, he got himself out
of that situation with some Irish logic
showing the cut and style of his ‘““‘young
man’s suit’! Mr. Sweeney bobbed and
weaved around the rostrum and spun
through some maniacal memories of his
to really liven-up the commencement.
To paraphrase any one of his stories
would be a criminal act. Let’s hope he
never loses his generosity. For it is a
generous man who takes time to re-

member the “shut ins.’

Most of the guests were at the ‘‘63”’
Banquet and Mr. Pete Byrone had no
hesitancy in keeping the functions on a
personal plain. Mr. Byrone gave Tony
Gonzales of the Phillies a fleeting in-
troduction. Tony took a bow and gave
us a wide grin. Tony Gonzales, original-
ly from Cuba, doesn’t speak much Eng-
lish; but that bat he wields for the
Phillies sure says alot. I think Warden
Rundle sensed how much we wanted to
hear from Tony Gonzales and per-
suaded Tony to say a few words. A
person with Tony’s conspicious ability
doesn’t need many words to communi-
cate especially when those people your
trying to communicate with are your
fans. Go get that batting title this year
Tony!

Stanley “‘Kitten’’ Haywood on the
road to the greatest recognition a
fighter can hope and dream for—the
championship of his division, wins an
important fight one night and comes to
jail the next night. The “‘Kitten’’ had
bandages and lumps over his face and
courage in his heart. A courage that
isn't eloquent, but bold and disciplined.
The basic factors necessary in a fighter.
If Stanley “‘Kitten’’ Haywood doesn’t
eventually claim the title, lack of dis-
cipline will probably be the reason why.
This, I believe, was the gist of his in-
formal talk with us... discipline. The
““Kitten”’ told us how he too must take
orders and obey certain restrictions in
order to reach his goal in life. Like his
manager Georgie Katz said; “‘Let’s hope

that when the “‘Kitten”’ comes back next
year it ll be the Champ Kitten Haywood
who is introduced to speak.”

George Katz followed Mr. Haywood
to the stage with some views on his
former fighter Sonny Liston. Mr. Katz,
a popular figure throughout this area,
answered queries for the inquisitive
from the audience. After answering
a small number of questions from the
audience he finished his evening off
with a few inside jokes and received a
resounding roar of applause.

Zack Clayton, a person of singular
distinction, who must proudly relive
daily the precedent he set when he re-
ferred a championship fight as a “‘first”’
for his race. Mr. Clayton was dressed
in his freman’s uniform under a sports
jacket. He captured his audience with
a remark about the coffee here and con-
tinued in an air of geniality. His terse
descriptive resume of his life in sports
was electrifying, and his sanguine en-
thusiasm was contagious. Mr. Clayton
spoke about the inordinate criticism of
people in the fight business. He went
on to say; “Television has stolen some
of the color from professional boxing”’
and “‘that television spectators find fault
with everything.” Mr. Clayton stole the
show with his honesty and flamboyant
illustrations. He reported how “one
must weed out the bad apples to pre-
serve the good ones in almost every
facet of entertainment or way of life.”’
We heartily thank Mr. Clayton for his
attendance and personal views, and

hope to see him with us again next
year.

Superintendent A. T. Rundle, took
the rostrum to wind up the Banquet
witha witty humor that surprised every-
one. He leveled a quip at Zack Clayton,
which was all in good clean fun. Mr.
Rundle thanked the guests for their
Presence and as mentioned previously,
persuaded Tony Gonzales to say a few
extra words. Time became scarce and
the traditional presentation of awards
was done haphazardly.

The following men received trophies

respective fields in the 1963 season:

As Maestro Giacinto Vizoca led the
band through a snappy rendition of
“Colonel Bogey”’ the Sportsmen’s Ban-
quet came to an abrupt end. The in-
mates filed swiftly and quietly out of
the auditorium doors into a refreshingly
cool crisp night, back to their respec-
tive blocks. We left our eminent guests
chatting jovially with each other in the
auditorium ... with good luck we hope
to see them again next year. 2
