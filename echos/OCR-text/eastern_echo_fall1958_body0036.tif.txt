FOOD...

for thought

There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but
the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. (Pro-
verbs 20:15)

Personal industry and accomplishment was ree-
ognized on the 8th of July, when a Banquet was
held in honor of Twenty Inmates who successfully
completed courses in our Institutional School. Ac-
companied by their capable Director, and Instruc-
tors Mr. Thomas Graham, Mr. Robert Burman and
“Jim” Beatty, the scholars assembled in the Officers’
Mess to allow their stomachs to enjoy the accom-
plishments of their brains. Under the auspices of
gracious hosts Mr .William Banmiller, Mr. Joseph
Brierly and Dr. Michael Morello, the graduates con-
sumed Steak smothered in Onions, French Fried
Potatoes, Peas, Iced Tea, Coffee, Cream and Sugar,
topped by delicious Marble Cake and Fruit Cock-
tail. As an added honorific presentation, the stu-
dious diners were served graciously by members
of our population.

Once the repast was complete, and belts were
loosened, Mr. Banmiller presided over the issuance
of the Certificates of Award. After congratulating
the Class as a group, signifying that all had gradu-
ated “Magna. Cum Laude”, Mr. Banmiller, in rep-
resentation of the members of the Staff assembled,
as well as himself, issued the certificates and his
personal congratulations. Individual Awards were
issued to Lewis Kocher, Joe Ryan, Marcelino
Gonzales, Alexander Torres, John Valentino, An-
thony Romano, James Russell, Jerome Chavis, Ed-
ward Gist, Nathaniel D. Easley, Willie Fordham,
Joseph Giblen, Elmer Daywalt, Sam Falvo, David
Wilder, Willie Stokes, James Byrd, and Abe Low-
man. Men, not. in attendance, who also received
awards, were James B. Jackson, and James Wilson.

A touch of humor, and also one of undeniable
warmth, was added by Sam Falvo. “Sam”, in his
newly acquired vocabulary, made a stirringly sin-
cere speech of acceptance, instilled through the
evident pride and joy of his new accomplishment.
A native Sicilian, “Sam” could neither read nor
write English (and could speak but very little) be-
fore inaugurating his attempt to break the Language

Barrier. Although well along in years in compari-
son to many of us, Sam is now the proud possessor
of a new tool of expression. Such is also the case
with our two fellow Americans from Puerto Rico,
Marcelino Gonzales and Alexander Torres. Their
diligence and success command your respect.

The twenty aforementioned men were awarded
a glossy, embossed piece of paper upon which re-
posed, in bold seroll, CERTIFICATE OF AWARD.
However, this piece of paper is in reality, a Golden
Key. Much as the famed Phi Beta Kappa insignia,
they now hold the golden key that can open the
doors to higher learning. Noting the enterprise
exerted by these men in the attempt to attain
achievement towards their future, it is certain that
this key shall not lie dormant in some secluded spot.
Rather, it is expected that the men who have not
allowed time to pass in wishful thinking shall again
choose to make their time serve them. The repeated
efforts of our Educational Department, Staff Board
and other Officials, have not been successful in hav-
ing our State Board of Education recognize the
Certificate of Award as comparable to outside edu-
cational Diplomas. However, the award in personal
advancement shall be recognized by many through-
out the years to come. It shall, no doubt, play an
important role in the possessor’s drama of life.

Why doesn’t the State Board of Education
recognize these Certificates? Who can tell? Cer-
tainly our Instructors and Educational Dept. are
qualified. The required work is comparable to out-
side schools. We can only anticipate that someone,
someday shall recognize these factors and duly
credit our Institutional Schools as a bona-fide part
of our State Educational System.

We do not wish to close without giving thanks
and congratulations to the Cooks and Waiters who
contributed so much to the success of the Banquet.
All participants wish to extend their appreciation
to Brown, Smitty, Cohen, Strange, Wickens, Robin-
son, Bezanis and Dougherty. The Cuisine was ex-
excellently prepared and the service left nothing to
be desired.
