Thoughts
by Albert B. Crosby

A Godly man once told me, “‘People
themselves are makers of themselves,”
by virtue of the thoughts which they
choose and encourage; that mind is the
master-weaver, both of the inner gar-
ment of character and the outer gar-
ment of circumstances, and that, as
they may have hitherto woven in ig-
norance and pain they may now weave
in enlightenment and happiness.

We know, do we not, the aphorism,
“As a man thinketh in his heart so is
he,” not only embraces the whole of
man’s being—but is so comprehensive
as to reach out to every condition and
circumstance of his life. A man
(woman) is literally what he thinks;
his character, being the complete sum
of all his thoughts.

As evident, the plant springs from,
and could not be without, the seed, so
every act of man springs from his hid-
den seeds of thought, and could not
have appeared without them.

And in knowing this we gain under-
standing and wisdom. And _ in this
direction, as in no other, is the law
absolute.

And he that seeks these truths; and
it be opened; for him there is only pa-
tierice, practice, and ceaseless oppor-
examine

tunity. Open your minds,

your consciences, and look ever on the

Godly things of life.

GRADUATION
EXERCISES

Our congratulations in this issue of the “ECHO” are channeled into several
directions. On May 2|st, Superintendent A.T. Rundle presented thirty-one inmates
with diplomas and certificates of achievement. The impressive ceremonies were
conducted in the officers’ dining room.

Mr. Ernest S. Patton, Director of Classification and Treatment, Bureau of Cor-
rections, was introduced by Mr. Thomas H. Graham, our Director of Treatment and
also Toastmaster for the evening. Mr. Patton spoke briefly on the benefits of our
extended educational program and congratulated the men for their achievements.
Mr. Patton was followed to the speakers rostrum by Dr. Benjamin Barkas from the
Philadelphia Board of Education. Dr. Barkas chose his words well, and spoke of
the insurance of the future that we all need, and that receiving a diploma was a step
in the right direction. Harry A. Snyder, Ph.D., Educational Program Specialist,
from the Bureau of Corrections, was the next speaker, and is one of the men
originally responsible for the Educational Programs we now have in the various
institutions throughout Pennsylvania. Dr. Snyder said, ‘‘great strides have been
made since the inception of Educational Programs inside the walls, and greater
strides will be made in the forseeable future.”

In closing the events of an interesting evening, Superintendent Rundle and the

Director of Education, Mr. Robert Burman, made the formal presentations of the
diplomas to:
HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES: Frederick Adams, Charles Buonassisi, Samuel
Goebert, Curtis Jarvis, James D. Mc Adams, Stanley Moroz, Arthur Pfrommer, and
James Robertson. PRE HIGH SCHOOL: Ronald Crawford, Ralph Forgione,
Eugene Hammen, Barney Kelly, John Joyner, Edward Leonard, Edward Smith, and
Robert Taylor.

The following men completed a course in ARCHITECTURAL DRAFTING and
CARPENTRY, and were presented with Certificates of Accomplishment.

Michael Agustine, Rogers Barbee, Edward J. O’Keefe, Robert L. Johnson, Michael
Robinson.

Certificates of Achievement were awarded to the following men for TYPEWRITER
REPAIR: Frederick Chester, Joseph Mc Nair, Franklin Schaeffer, Charles R. Swift.
The following men were awarded Certificates of Achievement in BOOKKEEPING:
Frederick Chester, John Giardino and Curtis Jarvis.

One man was awarded a Certificate in UPHOLSTERY, Jeddy Wilkins, and one
man for SIGN PAINTING & LETTERING, George Wallace.

Honorable mention should be given to the teachers and instructors who have been
so instrumental in making a successful effort with those men who wanted to learn,
so that they would be able to learn under the supervision of qualified personnel.
Mr. Robert Burman, Director of Education, Mr. William Berg, English and Social
Studies, Mr. Harry Gransback, Instructor, Biology and Geography, Mr. Roy Willing,
Instructor, Drafting and Carpentry, Mr. Larry Rees, Instructor, Lower Academic
Classes, Mr. Isadore Kurman, Instructor, Upholstery, Mr. Lawrence J. Kaul, Type-
writer Repair.

In addition to the more formal studies, classes are conducted in the manual
trades of plumbing, electricity, masonry and others, this instruction being primarily
in the nature of on-the-job-training.

The jail officials recognize the need for providing educational and vocational
training for inmates to give them some knowledge and training which they might
not have had prior to their confinement, and the administration encourages all those
who are sincere to exert themselves in the gaining of this knowledge and training
to better assist them in meeting those demands of the outside world.

Superintendent A. T. Rundle made it known that he was quite pleased with the
number of men who have taken good advantage of this program.

The achievement of these various groups should inspire even greater effort and
participation in the institution’s educational program. The men are to be com-
mended for their aggressiveness in starting and completing a tough job.

A nod of appreciation should be given to the instructors under the personal super-
vision of Mr. Robert Burman, Director of Education.
