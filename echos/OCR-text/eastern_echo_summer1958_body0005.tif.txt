CAGE

We, the inmates of ESP, are men who have broken the laws of society, and as lawbreakers,
must be punished, but while being punished, do we lose our dignity and cease being human be-
ings 2 A man who has broken the law or committed a crime has the same feelings, the same
emotions and ambitions as other human beings. The act he committed may have been the result
of blind passion or of a life of distorted viewpoints, out of keeping with what is considered right
and normal. But the mere fact that a man has broken the law and been sent to prison does not
stamp out his desires and ambitions, or make him any less a human being—even though all con-
demn his act.

Today, whether we admit it or not society still punishes for punishment sake. The majority
of our prisons are still grim man-cages, surrounded by high forbidding walls, patrolled by armed
guards and bristling with other restrictive devices. And although much progress has been made
in recent years in prison reform, the public still believes that merely locking a man up will sober
him and make him want to be a better person. Yet the reverse is usually true, most men come
out of such places worse than when they went in, filled with bitterness and even hatred for so-
ciety which deprived them of their freedom without giving them a chance to better their condition.

In the past few years, an idea has been gaining considerable ground. The idea of prisons
without guns, without armed guards, where the dignity of the individual is recognized and
where emphasis is placed on self-discipline.

In beginning its third year, THE EASTERN ECHO, devotes this issue to the idea that
prisoners are people, that the person who breaks the law is a HUMAN BEING who has the
right to be treated as such, that prisoners should be returned to society with a better attitude
than when they entered prison, that they must be taught the dignity of work and given an
opportunity to acquire new skills by which they may make an honest living and once again be-

come decent citizens.
