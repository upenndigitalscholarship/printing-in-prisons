By Thomas Williams

The E. S. P. Chess Club initiated a new system for
this year—the practical idea of playing during the
summer months. The main point of this idea was to
keep the club players’ skills sharp and at a peak, in
view of the long winter schedule ahead. In the past,
the players have shown themselves to be slightly off-
form after the long rest of three or four months. The
idea is a sound and logical one, but of course, it has
had a few setbacks due to its newness. These minor
obstacles eliminated themselves as the players became
adjusted to the new schedule. There have been sur-
prises and fun galore. Many formerly unrated play-
ers have held their own against seemingly more ex-
perienced competition.

On May 27, 1961, the E.S.P. Chess Club played host
to five students from the high school league. It was
D-Day for our players as these five youths blasted
our club for a 5-0 sweep. The following players scored
victories for the visitors: K. Camaratta, M. Rea,
B. Baezynskyj, J. Kolker and Oppenheim bested
A. Paschedag, W. Hallowell, R. Thompson, F. Jack-
son and J. Walker.

A simultaneous exhibition was held at the E.S.P.
Chess Club on July 29, 1961. Three rated Philadel-
phia Federation players opposed thirteen players of
our club and defeated them all. The visitors were:
Clarence Kalenian (Phila. Master), who defeated
H. Owens, S. Goldstein, D. Short and R. Cullen;
Richard Abrams (Phila. Expert), who defeated T.
Goodfellow, T. Williams, L. Massey and 8S. Moroz;
and C. Waltz (Phila. Expert), who defeated H. Far-
rel, J. Walker, M. Smith, W. Rosenzweig and K.
Thornton.

It was an enjoyable afternoon, and an assortment
of openings were displayed due to our members play-
ing black on all boards with numerous different de-
fenses being employed. In spite of the total amount
of losses, there were a few exceptional games of
merit. J. Walker of E.S.P., with a knight and pawn

up, stumbled into a lost position. T. Williams and 8.
Goldstein were outplayed in their quest for drawing
possibilities.

On June 10, 1961, five members of the Marple-
Newton Chess Club made another of their illustrious
visits to this institution. The clash of chess-minds
was again the dominating factor on this delightful
afternoon. The E.S.P Chess Club squeaked out a nar-
row (3-2) victory. ‘T. Brawner, li Massey and J.
Antoniwieez toppled respectfully: Arkless, C. Mur-
ter and P. Murter. On the losing side, we find F.
Jordan and M. Lees bowing to Reinmann and Beck-
ner. The following game illustrates the exemplary
play of the E.S.P. Chess Club members:

On July 15, 1961 we were delighted and surprised
by the visit of another of our old chess friends. The
E.S.P. Chess Club played host to Post 396, with Mr.
Kdward Strehle guesting the proceedings. Mr. Mar-
tin Pearson & Company’s happiness was short lived
however, as Post 396 displayed the wares that made
them the 1959-60 Champions of Philadelphia. The
K.S.P. Chess Club was literally demolished by a score
of 544—1%. It was a contest replete with errors.
Two H.S.P. players, R. Thompson and Champion
Andre Paschedag, blundered away their queens after
having theoretically won the games. Two games were
adjudicated as wins for Post 396 and the remaining
games were played to their limit. The games were
well fought, tense with excitement, and the over-
whelming desire of each player to be a winner. In
addition to the two games previously mentioned, we
had the following results: J. Bender (396) defeated
W. Hallowell (E.S.P), Z. Skorzewski (396) bested
T. Williams, I". Brauner (396) defeated R. Thompson
Cogs Ie.) CG. Coole (396) detested CL. None
(E.S.P.), J. Nienalt (396) defeated M. Quinn, R. Car-
din (396) lost to T. Goodfellow, and KE. Strehle (396)
drew with F. Jackson (E.S.P.).

NOTE: The E.S.P. Chess Club will only take on
outside competition for the rest of the summer. The
Club’s intramural matches have been temporarily
halted. Regular club matches will be resumed in
September with the full schedule. We will then be-
gin with our ¢lub championship, city championship
and chess in general. We are anticipating a wonder-
ful season, and this column will run a full report of
all the activities.
