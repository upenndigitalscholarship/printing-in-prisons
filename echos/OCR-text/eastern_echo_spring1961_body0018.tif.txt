Opinion...

@. After reading both, Professor Weihofen and
Dr. Davidson’s articles, do you feel that the Com-
monwealth should adopt the Durham Decision or
continue using the M’Naghten Ruling in cases where
there might be a question of insanity?

William Conrey—I'rankly, I feel that both methods
of determining insanity are antiquated. We are sup-
posed to be in the middle of an enlightened era in the
field of jurisprudence and sychiatry, yet we cannot
or rather it seems, will not, remedy the insanity issue
with the only solution that is available, a sort of
partnership between the psychiatrists and the courts.

The courts, in cases concerning insanity, refuse to
accept an answer of anything but yes or no—in those
states where the M’Naghten ruling is in effect—and
the psychiatrists insist, and rightly so, that they not
only cannot say in one word whether a man is men-
tally ill but refuse to acknowledge the word, insanity.

The problem could be solved if the courts were to
let the psychiatrist explain in detail what is wrong
with the defendent, if anything, and then recommend
to the judge that the man be committed to a mental
institution where he would be treated.

On the other hand, in the courts where the Durham
Decision is in effect, a psychiatrist can testify until
he is blue in the face and if the jury becomes em-
otionally involved it will make no difference what
he says.

Tor instance, we may, through testimony, recog-
nize a man as being a pyromaniae and mentally ill,
yet it several people were burned to death in a fire
that he set, could we, in all honesty, set our minds on
the question of insanity and ignore the dead bodies
which a prosecutor would always be bringing before

us? I think not. That is why I would leave it to the
courts to act upon the psychiatrists recommendation.

Going even further, it’s possible that all criminal
acts are caused by a sickness of some sort which, if
true, could make our judicial systems obsolete, be-
cause they are based upon the principle of punishing
someone who realizes that he is committing a crim-
inal act and can avert the commission of that act of
his own free will. This is ridiculous as there is, to my
way of thinking, no such thing as ““free will.’’ A
man is shaped from the cradle to the grave by out-
side influences. His environment may help turn him
into a thief; if his friends are drunks he may become
a drunkard; his size, if excessively gargantuan or
dwarfish, may effect his whole life; while in many
cases some disfigurement has turned an otherwise
honest person into a criminal.

Going deeper, there has been a growing awareness
of sublimal sychology of late. While I don’t know
too much about it, I did see where, in a recent demon-
stration, the word ‘‘blood’’ was flashed on a movie
screen during the showing of a picture, in such a brief
instanee, that the conscious mind was unaware of its
appearance, yet the word registered on the sub- con-
scious and the viewer actually identified a small pool
of some liquid as blood. Imagine the number of times
that some small thing has registered upon our mind
and helped shape our life without even being aware
Oia,

I drifted off course a little, but what I was trying
to show was that we are finding out so many things
about the mind it is impossible to make laws now
that will be valid in the future. In the interim, if
I had to make a decision, I would cast my vote for the
Durham Decision.  )

Our Cover illustration is taken from a collection of Honore Daumier lithographs,

entitled, “Les Gens De Justice.” Depicting a solicitor and his client, it bears the

caption:

Thief—” Just between us, | was the one that stole the watch. You won’t abandon my
case because |’m guilty, will your”

Lawyer—” My dear thief you don’t know my heart well. You must not have had much
contact with lawyers. Now that | am certain you did the job, I'll use the
alibi, cause | know where you were at during the crime.”

(Rough translation)

Like the greater majority of Daumiers work, it was satire intended to expose to

public gaze the mercenary and cunning barristers, suffering defendants, and

apathetic judges of his age.
