The Dilemma
of MODERN PENOLOGY

by L. J. BIANCONE

A prison inmate, like any other person, is re-
sponsible for his own record and reputation. How-
ever, type of adjustment, character and personality
development and progress are without doubt con-
tingent upon environment and treatment, whether it
be in prison or in any other community of society.
Hence, unrealistic criticism, as well as an excessive
prison term, can operate to the detriment of both a
prisoner’s adjustment to his environment and his
eventual rehabilitation; thus creating an unwhole-
some situation in an otherwise sound prison program.

Comparatively few first offenders are committed
to Eastern State Penitentiary. The institution is
primarily a maximum security prison, but it is more
and more evident that the policy of the Bureau of
Correction is one of treatment as distinguished from
punishment. This does not mean the prison has de-
veloped a country club atmosphere. It simply means
there is now a concerted effort, so far as available
facilities permit, toward rehabilitating a larger
percentage of inmates, without jeopardizing the
security of the prison. Thus far, there have been
some amazing and astonishing results.

If some judges and other public officials were
able to get a “‘bird’s-eye’’ view of this new policy
in action, they would soon learn that many of those
men who at one time were notorious in crime and
even in institutional adjustment, are now capable
of profittng by a treatment-minded program and
conducting themselves in a socially accepted manner.
Unfortunately, this does not mean that every in-
mate who is released from prison is a reliable parole
risk. There is absolutely no 100 per cent certain
yardstick to determine a parole risk. But, surely,
changing the character, attitudes and values of the
prisoner is the best known guarantee.

For it has been found that even the so-called
hardened criminal can become a reliable parole risk
under a sound institutional program. In illustra-
tion, when inmates who acquired notoriety in the
Willie Sutton era, consistently display visible prog-
ress and self-reorientation over a period of ten years
or more, not only does their conduct reflect credit
upon administrative policy, but their status as par-
ole risks is as good as that of the first offender. This
must be recognized, else treatment and rehabilita-
tion have no meaning in modern penology. It fol-
lows, as the night the day, that failure or neglect

to reap the harvest in due season, as indicated in a
previous article, will result in deterioration of the
inmates as well as the institutional program. Where
there is no faith, there can be no hope.

A popular and intelligent view of Eastern’s
treatment program is typically reflected in the state-
ment of an inmate who escaped with the notorious
Sutton in 1945, through a 90-foot tunnel dug deep
in the bowels of the ancient prison, and miracu-
lously escaped death when he was hit by a hail of
bullets from policemen’s blazing guns. Bill Russell,
who still suffers from wounds inflicted more than a
decade ago, counsels: ‘‘Once you realize what you
were, there’s no crime, wealth or pleasure worth
any further time spent behind bars to learn it all
over again.’’ Stroking his gray hair, he thought-
fully added: ‘‘Some people think some of us were
members of organized, syndicated crime, and there-
fore can’t be helped .. . but that kind of thinking
goes against the fact that such members don’t go to
prison. What the administration has to work with
here are unorganized rebels. Believe me, they can
be reached by a good program.’’

There is much logic in Russell’s statement. The
organized criminal has the protection and where-
withal to circumvent the law with apparent immu-

nity. Occasionally a renegade member is ferreted

out, as evident in present screaming headlines, but
usually gets his comeuppance in the form of a fine,
demotion, or suspension. He rarely sees the inside
of a prison.

Some judges and public officials unwittingly
frustrate the progress of some of our inmates, either
in imposing an excessive prison term to begin with,
or in the continued, unrelenting and unrealistic
criticism of already reformed men.

It might be concluded that the writer is at-
tempting to prepare a ‘‘ White Paper’’ for antisocial
behavior. That is not the case. Such an attempt
is admittedly as absurd as some of our radio and
T. V. commercials. The writer is merely suggesting
that such responsible persons stop trying to stem
the tide of crime with undue emotionalism, and a-
dopt a more realistic approach to the problem: one
which supports the intent and purpose of good penal
programs and which credits the socially acceptable
products they produce.
