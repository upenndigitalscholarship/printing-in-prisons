BIG BOYS DON'T CRY

by Francis A. Murphy

AUTHOR’S NOTE: My daughter, age 8, hag read
my alleged attempts at humor in every preceding
issue of the EASTERN ECHO. In her baby eyes, I
am Bob Hope, Jack Benny and Groucho Marx all
rolled up into one. But she wants to know when I
am going to write a story about HER.

Those of you who are fathers will need no ex-
planation of why I am writing this. To you cther
fellows, I just hope for a little compassion and
understanding. As most of you undoubtedly know,
I have been granted a commutation of sentence and
I should be on my way home about the time of
publication. So for bearing with me, and also for
the use of your magazine, good-bye, good luck and
many thanks to you all.

Colleen Nellie Margaret Murphy is your name.
You were just ninety days old when I last picked you
from your crib and held you in my arms. That
was over eight years ago. I have been fortunate in
many ways, for I have seen you every two weeks (for
such a little while!) in the visiting room, watched you
change from an infant in your mother’s arms to a
bright, green-eyed little girl of over eight years of
age... all behind a glass partition and a wire screen.

How many times have I heard you ask, *‘When
are you coming home, Daddy?’’ and for every time
you asked, I struggled to fight the tearg that I felt
forming in my eyes. I didn’t want you to see Daddy
erying, — big boys don’t ery (I wonder if I was
the exception, for I cried ... many times). How
many times in 8 years have you pressed your baby
lips to that screen to kiss me good-bye? And each
time you never knew the intense longing I experienced
just to be able to really touch your face, to pick
you up like a regular daddy would, to hold your tiny
hand, to hug you close to me. Mommie knew how I
felt and tears would come to Mommie’s eyes.

Colleen Nellie Margaret Murphy, you are a big
girl now. You get 95% in Spelling and 100% for
Reading. You understand many things now that
were a complete mystery to you, even just a short

year ago. You know this place where you see Daddy
every two weeks is a penitentiary, but you believe
Daddy works here. Your Mommie and I have told
you that. Yes, you were indoctrinated well. During
these years when you would ask, ‘‘ Why isn’t Daddy
ever home?’’ you would be told, ‘‘ Daddy is working.
Daddy has a special job. He can’t come home until
it’s finished.’’ You have been told that since you
were old enough to understand. Mommie and Daddy
told you that 22. = - so it must be true.

Well, honey, Daddy WILL be home now and
it’s only fair that your Mommie and I tell you WHY
Daddy was away so long, tell you WHY Mommie
and Daddy told you I was working; WHY I did the
things I did that sent me away for so long; WHY I
was never home to give you a piggy-back ride up to
bed; WHY I never knelt at your side at bedtime and
said, ‘‘God Bless Mommie and Gramp and Grandma
and Uncle George and Uncle Al and Unele Hank.”’
You see, honey, I have to explain all these things to
you. No one else can do it—I’m not sure I will be
able to do it well. But I’ll try, honey, and I’ll be
hoping that God will perform a little miracle and
open your baby heart and mind so you will under-
stand all that will be so difficult to tell you, and above
all, that Daddy loves you and Mommie, oh so very
much.

Daddy is very sorry he made you wait for so
long before coming home, and I realize I have a
big debt to pay to you and Mommie. I’ll have a
lot to do to make things up, but we’ll have a lot of
fun, honey, and it’s going to take me a lifetime to
repay you both, but I’ll love every second of it,
and I’ll do my level best.

This is not a real funny story, baby, like the
other one, but it’s a true story and after you read
it I wish you would climb up in my lap and ask
me questions. I promise I won’t le anymore...

P.S. Thank you, Floss. Hight years without miss-
ing a single every other week visit — and for a letter
EVERY DAY. Thank you, Mrs. Florence Murphy—
Wy Wile, . 2<-
