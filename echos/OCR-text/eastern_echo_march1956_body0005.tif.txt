Eastern EcnHo

An Open Letter
To The Inmates Of Eastern State Penitentiary

Dear Reader:

This is the first issue of the Eastern Echo. This magazine is the
newest entry into the Penal Press field. It will be the policy of the
editors to present articles, poems and stories which express the
thoughts and feelings of the men confined at this institution.

The Eastern Echo is your magazine. It will be only as good as
you want it to be. Some penitentiaries have a good magazine and
some have an indifferent one. The Eastern Echo is intended to be
the voice of the men in here. How powerful a voice depends upon
the quality and quantity of the material submitted. A lack of suitable
material will cause your editors to go to other Penal Press publications
for copy. If you have a story to tell but feel that you are unable to
put it down on paper, see an editor and he will write it as you tell it.
This applies not only to stories but to articles as well. You can write
on many subjects: courts, sentencing, rehabilitation, sports, music,
World War Two experiences, on any subject about which you feel
you have something to say.

Many of us have long looked forward to a publication for this
institution. Since I will be here for only this issue, | would like to
advance my hope that the Eastern Echo will continue to grow and
take its place among the top members of the Penal Press field. Keep
this magazine as the voice of all the men in here and not of just one
group. Remember that the articles and stories published by the
Eastern Echo will be read by many citizens of this and other states.
Poor material will reflect on all. Good material will bring favorable
responses and undoubted benefits. Make the Eastern Echo broad
and progressive in its outlook. Keep in mind the man who will
occupy your cell after you've been released—and the man after him.
Guard this tiny new flame of yours against the glory seeker and the
irresponsible. A new freedom has been handed to you by those in
authority—they will wait to see how you accept the responsibility
of it.

Sincerely yours,

- Editor
