		<h2>Opened in Philadelphia in 1829, Eastern State pioneered the so-called Pennsylvania System of solitary confinement.</h2> 
		<p>Individuals were caged alone in small cells, with no communication between each other or with the outside world.</p>
		<p>Though today we know that profound isolation  damages mental health, its original designers believed it would encourage introspection and penitence.</p>
		<p>By the end if the nineteenth century, this system had broken down, mostly due to a lack of space, and printing presses entered the prisons in the 1890s. Until the prison closed in 1971, the print shop produced forms, documents, and reports for the government and published a range of newspapers edited and written by the men incarcerated there.</p>
